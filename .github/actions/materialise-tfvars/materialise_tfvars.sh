# Body of the materialise-tfvars composite action, extracted (Decision 162 R2) so it is
# shellcheckable and directly testable under the literal GitHub composite argv
# `bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail <file>`. That argv, and a `set -euo pipefail` caller
# like bin/setup-cloud-env.sh, both export SHELLOPTS -- a child bash inherits it and re-applies
# errexit -- so this script may run with -e inherited or (a bare `bash materialise_tfvars.sh`)
# without it. Every failure path below is an explicit `if`/exit check rather than relying on
# errexit, so behaviour does not depend on which is in force.
#
# THE single Secrets Manager fetch for terraform/personal/terraform.personal.tfvars -- collapses
# the three inline "Materialise tfvars" / "Mask secret-sourced tfvars values in logs" / "Assert
# tfvars file is non-empty" steps that action.yml and terraform-drift.yml used to carry
# separately, and is also called directly from bin/setup-cloud-env.sh's ADMIN bootstrap branch, so
# CI and the local break-glass loop share ONE implementation.
#
# Takes NO arguments -- configuration is env-only ($GITHUB_ACTIONS gates ::add-mask::). Stays
# profile-free: all four CI apply call sites use OIDC ambient credentials, so hardcoding
# --profile agent_platform_admin would break them there. A PlatformDev container AccessDenies on
# this secret by design (per-ARN GetSecretValue enumeration, Decision 157) -- that is the intended
# DEP-13 fail-closed outcome, not a bug; re-run from an ADMIN container.
#
# No INSTALL_TERRAFORM gate here -- that belongs to the caller (bin/setup-cloud-env.sh's bootstrap
# branch). INSTALL_TERRAFORM appears zero times under .github/workflows/, so gating inside this
# shared unit would no-op every CI apply call site.
#
# On the success path with GITHUB_ACTIONS unset, this script is TOTALLY SILENT on both stdout and
# stderr (Decision 101: the local ADMIN shell must never print anything secret-shaped into the
# session transcript). Each failure mode (fetch failed, empty secret, write failed) emits its own
# pairwise-distinct, greppable stderr message so the three signals the collapsed CI steps used to
# carry survive in the log.
