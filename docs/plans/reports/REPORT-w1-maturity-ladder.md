# REPORT: W1 component 7 - maturity ladder controller (read_all -> sampled -> spot_check -> anomaly_triggered)

Plan: docs/plans/PLAN-w1-maturity-ladder.yaml. Fixture item: pwi-maturity-ladder-controller (1 of 12 cap).
REPORT-ONLY (Decision 86 cl.2): nothing here is built, filed, ratified or flipped. Every rec, table,
verb and schema change named below is a description of a future build.

## 0. Verdict

Every W1 component carries a maturity block, and none of those blocks can be run as written. The six
open items (#1384, #1390, #1394, #1395, #1396, #1397) declare 18 triggers. All 18 point upward; the
pilot schema accepts only the three upward adjacent pairs, so no item can declare a way back down (VP 1).
Every trigger metric is free text, no item states how many outputs a rung reviews, and nothing at runtime
reads a rung (VP 1, VP 2). Two consequences are measured, not argued:

- A clearance count with no return leg measures patience, not quality. "20 consecutive clean reviews" is
  reached after about 36 reviews at a 5% error rate and about 72 at 10%, and once passed nothing brings the
  component back (VP 2). In a seeded one-year simulation run through the controller SQL below, the declared
  triggers let a 20%-error component ship 11.1-12.6% of its outputs wrong and unreviewed, 13.3% on the
  worst seed (VP 5).
- A blinder monitor promotes faster. At a 5% error rate, 58 of 60 components whose failure_signal sees half
  the errors reach anomaly_triggered under the declared triggers, against 38 of 60 at recall 0.9 and 25 of
  60 at recall 1.0 (VP 5). The spot_check -> anomaly_triggered trigger is read off the same signal the top
  rung then relies on, so a weaker signal is rewarded.

The staged controller is one deterministic SQL per daily run (Decision 55). It reads a review log, the
component's failure_signal series, monitor drills and operator approvals. For each component it returns
promote, propose_promote, hold, demote or restart, with one of 11 reasons and the version the component
holds next. It passes 62/62 vectors (VP 4), sixteen of them by raising on malformed input or params, and
each of 46 hand-run mutants fails at least one vector. A version restart is monotonic on an ordered stamp.
It is a multi-level continuous sampling plan in the Dodge (CSP-1) and Lieberman-Solomon family: a
clearance count per rung, a return leg on any wrong output found above read_all, a restart on a version
change, a demotion on a breaching or dark failure_signal, and a windowed injected-fault drill before the
top rung. Its outgoing-quality bound is simulated, not closed-form: CSP-1's closed form (1.76% at
clearance 40, f 0.2) bounds only the first sampling level. The simulation spans the peak (error rates
0.005 to 0.2, recall 1.0, 0.9 and 0.5) on three seeds of 20 components per cell, and the bound depends on
monitor recall:
- With recall at or above the drill floor (0.9), escaped-wrong share peaks at 1.73% averaged over the
  seeds and 1.85% on the worst seed (p=0.03, recall 0.9). That is under the assumed 2% AOQL target (q3).
- With a half-blind monitor it peaks at 1.99% averaged and 2.09% on the worst seed (p=0.035), so the
  2% target is not met. A weaker monitor breaches less, so the signal demotes less.
- The drill keeps a half-blind monitor off the top rung except by chance (2 of 600 components). It does not
  remove the weaker-monitor advantage inside the 0.03-0.045 band: there a 90%-recall monitor reaches the
  top in 64 of 240 components against 37 of 240 for a perfect one. Below p=0.02 the two match (60 of 60).
  Cures are named under k5, not claimed.
That is paid for in review load: a 2%-error component is reviewed on 20-21% of its outputs instead of
3.7-3.9% (VP 5, section 2.6).

What is settled is narrow: the four rungs and their order (evaluator code), a deterministic decision
(Decision 55), and the measured facts above. The return leg, the version-change rule and promotion
authority are forks with credible alternatives and no admissible precedent (T3.4 and T4.4 call for per-gate
rollback, but that is roadmap text, not a Decision or contract), so they are parked (k1-k3). The decision
rule's family and seeds (k4), the drill (k5) and the fixture's edge home (k6) are parked report-only. Both #1396 and #1397 defer one
question to this component: whether a params_version change restarts the ladder. That is k2, and its
recommendation is restart at read_all.

## 1. Evidence (each row re-derivable; VP step in brackets)

| id | fact | anchor |
|---|---|---|
| e1 | Rungs are a closed Literal of four, and `Maturity.transitions` must be exactly the three upward adjacent pairs in order; a downward pair is refused and no other maturity field exists [VP 1] | scripts/checks/roadmap/_work_item_pilot_model.py:48, :151-158 |
| e2 | `Trigger.metric` is free text (3-120 printable characters); "anything at all" validates, so no trigger names a computable series [VP 1] | scripts/checks/roadmap/_work_item_pilot_model.py:131-133 |
| e3 | No file under src/ or scripts/ outside the pilot model and its evaluator mentions anomaly_triggered or spot_check: nothing at runtime reads or writes a rung [VP 1] | repository grep |
| e4 | The six open W1 items declare 18 transitions, 18 upward and 0 downward. First-rung clearances are 20 (five items) or 50 consecutive clean reviews; second-rung clearances are zero failures in the last 30, 50 or 200 sampled; five of six third-rung triggers are 30 days of a failure_signal at or under a threshold [VP 2; fidelity against the branch heads, VP 3] | section 1.1 |
| e5 | Zero failures in n reviews bounds the error rate at 95% only to 1 - 0.05^(1/n): 13.9% at n=20, 5.8% at n=50, 1.5% at n=200 [VP 2] | section 1.2 |
| e6 | With no return leg, a consecutive-n trigger fires eventually at any error rate; the expected number of reviews before 20 consecutive clean ones is 36 at p=0.05, 72 at p=0.1 and 429 at p=0.2 [VP 2] | section 1.2 |
| e7 | CSP-1 (Dodge 1943): 100% review until i consecutive clean outputs, then a fraction f, back to 100% on any defect found. Its average outgoing quality limit at f=0.2 is 3.44% for i=20 and 1.76% for i=40 [VP 2] | section 1.2 |
| e8 | T3.4 exit criterion 2 asks for maturity gates A0-A3 with a per-gate rollback criterion; T4.4 asks that every gate carry a numeric threshold with its denominator, window and data source, and that rollback be automatic on breach (roadmap text, not a Decision) | docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml:6594, T4.4 exit criteria |
| e9 | Both #1396 and #1397 end their maturity text with the same deferral: "A params_version change is a new rule set; the maturity-ladder controller decides whether it restarts the ladder" | REPORT-w1-rec-filing-dedupe.md section 4; REPORT-w1-back-validation.md section 4 (unmerged) |
| e10 | Decision 73 halt check: the reader's named verb ci_rca_open returned [] at 2026-10-03T12:07:41Z | Step 0 |

### 1.2 What the declared clearances certify

Computed in VP 2 from the inventory block. `ucb95` is the 95% upper bound on the error rate certified by n
clean reviews in a row; `reviews_to_clear` is the expected number of reviews before the first run of n
clean ones at error rate p ((1 - q^n) / (p q^n), q = 1 - p), which is how long a component with that error
rate waits before the trigger fires anyway when nothing ever sends it back.

| first-rung n | items | ucb95 | reviews_to_clear p=0.05 | p=0.10 | p=0.20 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 20 | capture, friction, deliberation, rec-filing, back-validation | 0.139 | 36 | 72 | 429 |
| 50 | reader-verbs | 0.058 | 240 | 1930 | 350320 |

The second rung's "zero in the last n sampled" (n = 30, 50 or 200) is the same statistic on sampled
outputs. With no return leg it is reachable at n=30 or 50 for error rates up to about 5%, and at n=200
almost never above 2%. A component that stalls at sampled keeps shipping p(1 - f) of its outputs
unreviewed.

CSP-1 is the textbook fix for exactly this ladder. Its clearance number is the same consecutive count, and
its guarantee (the AOQL) holds only because a defect found while sampling returns to 100% review. At f=0.2
the AOQL is 3.44% for i=20 and 1.76% for i=40 (VP 2; AOQ(p) = p(1 - f)q^i / (f + (1 - f)q^i), maximised
over p). The declared triggers keep CSP-1's clearance and drop its return leg. These closed forms describe
a single sampling level. The staged controller adds two more levels (f^2, f^3) and leaves the top only on a
found wrong output or a signal breach, so its own bound is simulated (section 2.6), not closed-form.

## 2. Controller design (what this item stages)

### 2.1 Rung semantics

| rung | routine review | effects the sibling items allow (their text) |
|---|---|---|
| read_all | every output (f = 1) | proposals only: the filer files nothing (#1396 c3), back-validation closes nothing (#1397 c3) |
| sampled | f_sampled of outputs | filer files under its per-run budget (#1396 k3 (a)); a holds verdict is close_proposed (#1397 k1) |
| spot_check | f_spot_check of outputs | as sampled |
| anomaly_triggered | an audit floor f_anomaly_triggered, plus review on a failure_signal breach | back-validation may close directly (#1397 k1 recommendation) |

Selection is per output and deterministic: an output is reviewed when the rung is read_all or when
md5(salt, component, output_id) maps below the rung's fraction. The salt is per component and version, so
a version change re-draws the sample. The levels follow multi-level plans (f, f^2, f^3 with f = 0.2), with
a non-zero audit floor at the top so the monitor is never the only witness. Effects stay the siblings'
business; the controller decides only the rung.

### 2.2 Inputs

`{state}`: one row per component: component, rung, entered_day (first day at this rung), version (the
component's rule-set stamp: classifier_version, parser_version or params_version; stamps sort in deploy
order, so a rollback is minted as a new, higher stamp), signal_threshold.
`{reviews}`: one row per selected output: component, output_id, day, version, rung (at production), outcome
(correct, wrong or unsure; NULL while pending). `{signal}`: one row per component per day: the
failure_signal value, NULL when undefined (deliberation's "undefined, never 0" maps here). `{drills}`: one
row per injected-fault run: component, day, injected, detected; only runs in the last drill_window_days of
the stint count, so one old miss does not block the top rung for good (v39). `{approvals}`: one row per operator
approval: component, to_rung, day. `{today}` is the run's day. All five are build-time objects (q2).

Params are data, stamped as params_version on every transition record (seed values, unmeasured, q3):

```yaml
params_version: 1
clear_read_all: 40
clear_sampled: 40
clear_spot_check: 20
review_sla_days: 3
dark_days: 2
signal_window_days: 30
drill_min: 20
drill_window_days: 20
drill_recall_min: 0.9
on_wrong: read_all
signal_demotes: true
signal_gates_promotion: true
version_restart: true
promotion_authority: operator
f_sampled: 0.2
f_spot_check: 0.04
f_anomaly_triggered: 0.008
```

### 2.3 The decision

Malformed inputs and params raise instead of deciding (fail loud, Decision 55): an unknown rung, a NULL
state field or a duplicate component (e01, e07, e08); an on_wrong or promotion_authority outside its
vocabulary (e12, e13); a review row with a NULL component (e09) or another NULL key (e04); a duplicate output_id
(e02); an outcome outside the vocabulary (e03); a duplicate failure_signal day (e05); a signal row with a
NULL component (e14) or day (e10); a drill row with a NULL component (e15), day (e16) or count (e11), or
more detected than injected (e06). Each raise vector
matches its error message, not any DuckDB error. The guards are aggregates read by the final CASE, so no optimiser can skip them.

Clearance counts correct reviews at the current rung and version since the last breaker. A breaker is a
wrong or unsure review, or a selected output still unreviewed after review_sla_days. A pending review
inside the SLA neither counts nor breaks (v07, v36). An unreviewed sample therefore resets the count:
skipping the hard cases cannot buy a promotion (Goodhart).

Every output row carries to_version, the version the component holds after the decision. On a restart it
is the highest stamp above the state's seen in the stint (v41, v44); otherwise it is the state's. Because
stamps are ordered, a restart is monotonic: a late or overlapping output from an older stamp neither
restarts the component nor rolls its stamp back (v42), and while two stamps both produce, only the current
one's reviews count toward clearance (v43). The caller writes to_version back with the rung and
entered_day, so the next run at the new version holds instead of restarting again (v40). The ordering is a
contract on the stamp (a zero-padded counter or a timestamp sorts as text); its alternatives are k2's
sub-question.

| action | reason | when (precedence top-down) | vectors |
|---|---|---|---|
| restart | version_change | a review in the stint carries a stamp above the state's, when version_restart (k2); to_version is the highest such stamp | v18, v19, v25, v41, v44 |
| demote | wrong_found | a wrong review at the current rung above read_all; to read_all or one rung down per on_wrong (k1); never at read_all | v08, v09, v26, v30, v31 |
| demote | signal_breach | above read_all, today's failure_signal exceeds the threshold (strictly), when signal_demotes; one rung down | v11 |
| demote | signal_dark | above read_all, no defined failure_signal value in the last dark_days days; one rung down | v12, v32 |
| hold | top | at anomaly_triggered with nothing to demote | v13 |
| hold | review_overdue | a selected output in the stint is past the SLA unreviewed | v06 |
| hold | clearing | clearance below the rung's clear_* | v03, v04, v05, v29, v36 |
| hold | signal_not_clean | today's failure_signal undefined or above threshold, when signal_gates_promotion | v20, v21, v22 |
| hold | signal_window | at spot_check, fewer than signal_window_days clean days inside the stint | v15 |
| hold | awaiting_drill | at spot_check, when drill_min > 0: fewer than drill_min faults injected in the last drill_window_days of the stint, or fewer than drill_recall_min of them detected | v16, v17 |
| promote | cleared | an approval for the next rung dated inside the stint, or promotion_authority auto (k3) | v02, v27 |
| propose_promote | cleared | otherwise | v01, v07, v10, v14, v23, v24, v28, v33, v34, v35, v37, v38, v39, v40 |

Rows outside the stint (before entered_day, after today) and rows recorded at another rung are ignored
(v28, v29, v37). Several components decide independently in one run (v30).

### 2.4 Vectors (VP 4)

`reviews` rows expand to n outputs on one day; `signal` rows cover a day range with one value.
`expected: error` vectors carry the message substring they must raise.

### 2.6 Simulation (VP 5)

One year, 12 outputs a day per component (the order of magnitude #1397 measured for sessions), 20
replicate components per (error rate p, monitor recall r) cell on each of three seeds, so 60 per cell. The
error rates are 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.035, 0.04, 0.045, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2; the band 0.02-0.05 is where
a multi-level plan's outgoing quality peaks. Monitor recall is 1.0, 0.9 or 0.5. The failure_signal is the 7-day share of outputs that are wrong and seen by the monitor; threshold
0.05. A drill injects one fault per spot_check day, detected with probability r. The reviewer is perfect
and immediate, errors are independent at a constant p, and every proposal is approved (the most permissive
operator). Draws are md5 over the seed, the component, the day and the output, so the result is identical
on every run; the seed only re-draws, so seed-to-seed spread is sampling noise, not a rule change. Both rules use the staged review fractions, because no declared item states one (e1).

The `declared` rule is the controller with the declared shape: clearance 20 then 50, a 30-day clean signal
window to the top, no return leg, no signal demotion, no version restart, no drill. The simulation never
changes a version, so k2 is exercised by vectors only. `staged` is the params
block. Each simulated day runs the controller SQL above, unchanged, over every component.

Read across: the declared rule's escape rate tracks p (0.111-0.126 at p=0.2, 0.133 on the worst seed).
The staged rule's peaks in the 0.03-0.045 band, and the peak depends on monitor recall. With recall 0.9 or
1.0 it is 1.73% averaged and 1.85% on the worst seed (p=0.03, recall 0.9). With recall 0.5 it is 1.99%
averaged and 2.09% on the worst seed (p=0.035), above the assumed 2% target on two of three seeds. Both exceed
CSP-1's first-level 1.76% on at least one seed, which is why section 1.2's closed form is not this rule's bound.
The mechanism is the signal. It is the share of outputs that are wrong and seen, so a monitor that sees
less breaches less often and demotes less often. That raises escapes for a weak monitor, and in the
band where p times recall sits just under the 0.05 threshold it lets a 90%-recall monitor reach the top
more often than a perfect one: 64 of 240 components against 37 of 240 over p 0.03-0.045, the declared
rule's pattern, damped. Below p=0.02 both reach the top in every component. A half-blind monitor reaches
it in 2 of 600 (p <= 0.01, a chance pass of the windowed drill). Past the band, a bad component keeps
returning to read_all (afi near 1) and escapes fall toward 0. Under the declared ladder a half-blind
monitor helps (p=0.05: 58 of 60 against 25 of 60 at recall 1.0). The price of the staged rule is review
load on middling components: at p=0.02 it reviews 20-21% of outputs against 3.7-3.9%, for an escape rate
of 1.55-1.61% against 1.88-1.93%. Whether that trade is worth it is the
AOQL target, a seed (q3). Simplifications that matter: a real reviewer errs (R3), errors cluster after a
change (which version_restart addresses and the simulation does not exercise), and harm per escaped
output differs by component (R6).

## 3. Settled / contested / risk / open

### Settled (fixture s1-s3)

- s1 The rungs are read_all, sampled, spot_check and anomaly_triggered in that order (pilot model code, e1),
  and the transition decision is deterministic code over recorded reviews, never an LLM (Decision 55).
- s2 Measured: the 18 declared triggers are upward-only free text and no item states a review rate, so no
  controller can evaluate them as written (VP 1, VP 2).
- s3 Measured: without a return leg the declared triggers let escaped-wrong share track the error rate
  (0.11-0.13 at p=0.2) and promote half-blind monitors faster (VP 5). Any rule must bound outgoing quality
  and must not reward a weaker monitor; which rule does so is k1, k4 and k5. The staged rule does both only
  in part: its bound holds for recall at or above the drill floor, and a damped weaker-monitor advantage
  remains in the peak band (section 2.6).

### Contested (k1-k3 in the fixture; k4-k6 report-only, the fixture's contested list is capped at 3)

- k1 The return leg.
  - (a) Any wrong output found above read_all returns the component to read_all (CSP-1; v08).
  - (b) One rung down (multi-level plans; on_wrong one_down, v09).
  - (c) None, as the six items declare (on_wrong none, v10).
  Recommended: (a). It is the strictest return. In the simulation it keeps escaped-wrong share at or under
  1.85% on every seed when monitor recall is at or above the drill floor, but a half-blind monitor reaches
  2.09% on the worst seed (VP 5), so the bound is conditional on recall. The bound is simulated, not closed-form: CSP-1's 1.76% covers its
  first level only. The cost is review load on a component that just proved it errs. (c) is measured in
  VP 5, and (b) is not simulated. Precedent: none admissible; T3.4
  criterion 2 and T4.4 call for per-gate rollback (e8), but they are roadmap criteria, and the pilot schema
  today forbids a downward pair (e1). Class asked.
- k2 A version change (classifier_version, parser_version or params_version), the question #1396 and
  #1397 both defer here (e9).
  - (a) Restart at read_all with the new version, which the controller returns as to_version (v18, v19,
    v40-v44).
  - (b) Drop one rung and keep counting.
  - (c) Keep the rung; the change rides on the existing sample.
  Recommended: (a). A rule-set change is a new process, and a clearance earned by the old rules says
  nothing about the new ones (the acceptance-sampling convention for a process change). Its cost falls on
  frequent small edits, so the build may want a declared cosmetic class (for example a rules-file comment)
  that does not bump the stamp. No precedent. Class asked.
  Inside (a), how a newer version is recognised. Verification r2 showed that "newest by date" rolls the
  stamp back on a late old-version output and restarts on every run while two versions overlap.
  - (a1) An ordered stamp: restart only on a stamp above the current one, to the highest seen (staged;
    v42-v44). One comparison, no history needed; a rollback must mint a new, higher stamp.
  - (a2) First-seen order: newer means first seen later in the review log. No stamp format is imposed,
    but every version's first appearance must be retained (q2).
  - (a3) Ladder state per (component, version), so overlapping versions each climb on their own reviews.
    Under (a1) a wrong output from a still-live older version counts toward nothing (v43); (a3) would let
    it demote that version.
  Recommended: (a1), and (a3) if versions overlap for long (#1395's trigger reads "for every
  parser_version present").
- k3 Who moves a component.
  - (a) The operator approves every promotion (propose_promote until an approval exists, v01/v02);
    demotions and restarts apply automatically.
  - (b) Both automatic (promotion_authority auto, v27).
  - (c) The operator ratifies both, with only the record automatic (T4.4's last exit criterion reads this
    way for A-gates).
  Recommended: (a). A promotion loosens oversight and is rare; a demotion tightens it and must not wait for
  a human who may be away. No Decision or contract decides it. Class asked.
- k4 (report-only) The rule family and its seeds. (a) The staged multi-level CSP: consecutive clearance per
  rung with k1's return leg (as above). (b) A sequential probability ratio test per rung (Wald), which
  decides on all reviews, not runs, with stated error rates at two quality levels. (c) A fixed-sample
  bound: promote when the 95% upper bound on the error rate since rung entry is under a target. Also inside
  k4: unsure counts as a breaker (v05), an overdue sample is a breaker (v06), and a promotion needs a clean
  signal today (signal_gates_promotion, v20-v22). Recommended: (a) for the pilot, because its first level
  has a closed-form bound, its whole-ladder bound is simulated (VP 5), and it matches what the siblings
  already wrote; revisit (b) if review volume is the
  constraint. Measurement is not precedent. Class asked.
- k5 (report-only) Monitor validation before anomaly_triggered. (a) A windowed drill: at least drill_min
  faults injected in the last drill_window_days of the spot_check stint, with at least drill_recall_min of
  them detected (v14, v16, v17, v38, v39). (b) Historical recall: the share of reviewer-found wrong outputs
  on whose day the signal breached, over at least m findings. (c) None, as declared. Recommended: (a),
  with its costs stated. The bar is a recall floor, not perfection: at 18 of 20, a 90%-recall monitor
  passes on about 68% of reads, and at p <= 0.01 it reaches the top in all 60 components, as a
  perfect one does (VP 5). Because the window
  re-reads daily, a half-blind monitor can pass it by chance (2 of 600 components). A zero-miss rule over
  the whole stint closes that, but blocks a 90%-recall monitor almost entirely, and one miss holds it until
  a demotion (verification r1 probe). The drill gates the top rung only; it does not correct the signal.
  In the 0.03-0.045 band a 90%-recall monitor still reaches the top more often than a perfect one (64 of
  240 against 37 of 240), and a half-blind one lets more errors escape below the top (2.09% worst seed),
  because a signal that sees less breaches less (verification r2). Candidate cures, not adopted or
  simulated: (a1) divide the signal by the drill-measured recall before comparing it to the threshold;
  (a2) a drill floor nearer 1.0 over a longer window; (a3) a drill at sampled and spot_check too, so a weak
  monitor is caught before the top. (b) cannot be computed for a component that rarely errs, and (c) is the half-blind result in
  VP 5. The drill for back-validation already exists in kind: #1397's VP 3 feeds known
  no-op fixes through the verdict SQL. No precedent. Class asked.
- k6 (report-only) The fixture item's edge home. (a) part_of T3.4, whose exit criterion 2 asks for maturity
  gates with a per-gate rollback criterion. (b) part_of T4.4, which owns rollback automation but depends on
  the frozen executor (T4.2, Decision 67). (c) part_of T3.3 or T3.20, the parents of the components the
  ladder governs. The fixture carries (a), with depends_on T2.36, as a reversible pilot row
  (edges_disposition pilot_only). (a)'s premise rests on roadmap text, which is not admissible precedent,
  and it is tied to q1: if this ladder is separate from T3.4's A0-A3, the criterion-2 reading weakens. No
  precedent. Class asked.

### Risks

- R1 Review load. At read_all the operator reviews every output: at 12 a day for each of six components,
  about 72 reviews a day, and a component that keeps returning stays there (VP 5 afi near 1 at p >= 0.1).
  Unreviewed samples hold the ladder by construction (review_overdue), so an absent operator freezes
  promotion rather than loosening review.
- R2 Predictable sampling. md5 selection over a known salt lets anyone who knows the salt see which
  outputs will be reviewed. The producers are deterministic SQL today, so the risk is a future adaptive
  producer; the salt is per component and version and can be withheld from the producer.
- R3 Reviewer error. Clearance trusts the review outcome. A reviewer who confirms everything inflates it;
  seeded known-wrong outputs in the review stream (a reviewer drill) would measure that. Named for the
  Goodhart register.
- R4 Small daily denominators. At about 12 outputs a day a daily share threshold of 0.05 is an "any error"
  alarm (one wrong output is 0.083). The declared signal triggers name thresholds but not windows; T4.4
  asks for both (e8). The simulation uses a 7-day window.
- R5 Coupled components. An upstream component at read_all (capture, reader verbs) makes a downstream
  component's review outcomes partly about its inputs. A rung ceiling by dependency is W2's question
  (section 5).
- R6 Unequal harm. One escaped wrong proof close (back-validation) costs more than one escaped mislabel.
  The AOQL target may need to be per component; the Goodhart register owns the weights.

### Open questions (q1-q3 in the fixture, q4 report-only)

- q1 Is this ladder T3.4's A0-A3 (executor autonomy gates) or a separate per-component review ladder that
  shares the controller? T3.4 and T4.4 describe autonomy of the executor; these rungs describe how much of
  a loop component's output a human reviews. Recommended reading: separate ladders, one controller, and
  T4.4's numeric pinning (threshold, denominator, window, source) applied to both.
- q2 Where review records, transition records and the current rung live. Nothing reads a rung today (e3).
  Shares rec-filing q4 (Decision 199 journal recommended there) and back-validation q4.
- q3 Seeds are unmeasured: AOQL target (2% assumed; the staged rule meets it on every seed only with
  monitor recall at or above the drill floor), clearances 40/40/20, fractions 0.2/0.04/0.008,
  review_sla_days 3, dark_days 2, a 30-day window, a drill of 20 faults in 20 days at recall 0.9; operator
  review capacity at read_all.
- q4 (report-only) Is a failure_signal breach at sampled a demotion or only a hold? The staged rule
  demotes one rung (v11). A component whose signal and reviews disagree needs a reviewer's look either way.

### Named for owners, not filed (Decision 67)

- O1 Pilot schema (evaluator owner): Maturity cannot express a return leg, a review fraction or a version
  rule, and Trigger.metric is free text (e1, e2). Whatever k1, k4 and k5 decide needs a schema change
  before any item can declare it; until then the fixture records the forks, not the rule.
- O2 T3.4 exit criterion 2 grounds its rollback requirement on "Decision 92 points 6-9", but Decision 92 is
  the agent-native Terraform CI/CD ratification and no Decision mentions MED-9 (grep). The anchor looks
  stale (inferred; the roadmap owner should confirm).

## 4. Consideration register (as authored in the fixture)

- why: the six items' 18 triggers are upward-only free text with no review rate (VP 1, VP 2), so promotion
  measures patience, and a blinder monitor promotes faster (VP 5).
- how: one SQL per daily run over the review log, failure_signal series, drills and approvals per component
  returns promote, propose_promote, hold, demote or restart with a reason and the version held next; the
  rule's legs are k1-k5.
- planes: data_plane (it runs over the customer's own review and telemetry rows; rung and transition
  counts are candidates for the rec-4141 allow-list, not decided here).
- maturity: the controller is itself a component. read_all means every transition is a proposal the
  operator re-derives before any rung moves (c3). read_all -> sampled at >= 40 controller decisions the
  operator re-derived unchanged since the last overturned one; sampled -> spot_check at >= 40 more on a
  1-in-5 sample; spot_check -> anomaly_triggered at >= 30 consecutive days with stale_rung_days 0 and
  the escaped-share estimate at or under the AOQL target (q3). These are clearance counts; their return leg is k1,
  which the schema cannot yet express (O1).
- failure_signal: a component sits at a rung its own evidence contradicts. Metric: est_escaped_share, an
  estimator with a stated denominator and window. Per component above read_all, over a rolling 30-day
  window: (wrong among audited samples / audited samples) x (unreviewed outputs / all outputs). Beside it,
  stale_rung_days (days a demote condition held with no transition recorded). Counting only the wrong
  outputs review found would read about f x p (0.0008 at the top rung for p = 0.1) and stay green while 10%
  escape; the estimator scales the audited error rate up to the unreviewed share instead. At the top rung
  the audited sample is small (about 3 a month at 12 outputs a day), so the estimate is noisy and is read
  beside the component's own failure_signal, never instead of it. Source: the review log (audited samples
  and unreviewed counts) and the transition log (q2).
- verification: c1 (the SQL passes these vectors over the build's tables; each transition record carries
  reason, counts, to_version and params_version, and the caller writes to_version back), c2 (a seeded
  simulation through the controller, over a grid spanning the AOQ peak band (p 0.005-0.2, recall 1.0, 0.9
  and 0.5) on at least three seeds, keeps escaped-wrong share at or under the AOQL target on every seed in
  every cell whose monitor recall meets the drill floor, reports the mean and worst-seed share for the
  cells below it, and lets no low-recall monitor reach the top more than by chance),
  c3 (the operator's read_all review of every transition). All open.
- rollback: stop the schedule and set every component to read_all; the transition log stays as history and
  review returns to 100% until a controller resumes. Failing safe means more review, never less.
- edges: part_of T3.4 (exit criterion 2: gates with a per-gate rollback criterion; the home is parked as
  k6); depends_on T2.36 (the inputs are telemetry reader rows on DuckLake, like every sibling).

## 5. Boundary notes for W2 synthesis

- Rec filing (W1-5, #1396): its k2 recommendation surfaces the suppressed-sessions trend "to the
  maturity-ladder controller"; here that trend is a failure_signal input, and a breach demotes (v11). Its
  rejected_share is the review outcome stream (rejected = wrong). Its params_version change restarts the
  ladder under k2 (a). Its read_all files nothing, so a read_all review is a review of proposals.
- Back-validation (W1-6, #1397): "close_proposed until anomaly_triggered" makes this controller the gate for
  direct proof closes. Under k5 (a) its drill is its own VP 3 simulation run on known no-op fixes: a holds
  on a drill fix is a missed detection. Its spot_check -> anomaly_triggered trigger (false_proof_rate over 90
  days with at least 20 proof closes) maps to a signal window only if the producer emits the 90-day rate
  as its daily value, or the window becomes per component; signal_window_days is one global 30 today. Same
  k2 answer.
- Friction classifier (W1-3, #1394): its version stamp is classifier_version, and every rules edit bumps
  it; under k2 (a) that restarts the ladder, which is why k2 suggests a cosmetic class. Its precision comes
  only from label review (its q2), so its review log is the controller's main input.
- Deliberation capture (W1-4, #1395): deliberation_drift_share is "undefined, never 0" when nothing is
  classified; the controller reads undefined as dark, so a silent producer demotes rather than looks clean.
- Capture producer wiring (W1-1, #1384) and reader verbs (W1-2, #1390): upstream of everything. W2 should
  decide a rung ceiling by dependency (a component's rung at most its upstream's, or one above), using the
  pilot depends_on edges W2 adds.
- Goodhart register (later W1): R3 (reviewer drift) and R6 (unequal harm) belong there, and each
  component's failure_signal is the controller's signal input, so a detector's failure_signal in that
  register and here must be one series.
- Cost/egress budget (later W1): review load is the controller's cost; afi times output volume is the
  number of human reviews a day.
- Contradiction for W2: the six items write first-rung clearances of 20 and 50 and second-rung windows of
  30 to 200. One controller needs one rule family (k4) with per-component seeds, or the inventory stays
  six dialects.

## 6. Staged candidate decision text (for W3; not filed)

"A loop component's review rung moves only by a deterministic controller over recorded reviews. Every
upward transition is paired with a return leg: a wrong output found above read_all returns the component
to read_all, a failure_signal that breaches or goes dark demotes it, and a rule-set version change
restarts it at read_all. Promotion needs operator approval; demotion and restart apply on the run that
finds them. The top rung needs a passed monitor drill with a stated recall floor. Thresholds are stated with their denominator,
window and source."
