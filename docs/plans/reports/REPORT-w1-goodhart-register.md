# REPORT: W1 component 9 - Goodhart register (a counter series and a seeded drill for every failure_signal)

Plan: docs/plans/PLAN-w1-goodhart-register.yaml. Fixture item: pwi-goodhart-register (1 of 12 cap).
REPORT-ONLY (Decision 86 cl.2): nothing here is built, filed, ratified or flipped. Every table, verb, schema
change and drill named below describes a future build. The eight sibling W1 components (#1384, #1390,
#1394-#1399) are unmerged: they are read here as evidence at pinned heads, never cited as precedent.

## 0. Verdict

The charter asks that every loop component carry its own failure_signal, and every W1 item does: the pilot
schema requires one (scripts/checks/roadmap/_work_item_pilot_model.py:162). The Goodhart question is the next
one: when that signal looks good, how would we know it is the signal, and not the work, that improved?
Decision 196 clause 7 puts the same question to Tier A decisions ("how would we know we have overfit to
this?"); it binds there, and is used here only by analogy. This component answers it per detector and
measures the answers.

Measured, not argued:

- Every W1 failure_signal is lower-is-better, and every one is read as a promotion trigger by its own item.
  In 7 of 8 items the top-rung trigger (spot_check -> anomaly_triggered) names the item's own failure_signal
  metric; the eighth (#1390) reads "zero mismatches", which is its metric in other words (VP 1).
- The signals carry little protection against their own blind spots. 4 of 8 name a companion series read
  "beside" them, 1 of 8 (#1399's canary) names a seeded known-positive, and 0 of 8 top-rung triggers check
  the recall of the signal they promote on (VP 1). The maturity-ladder report (#1398, unmerged) measured the
  consequence: a monitor that sees half the errors reaches the top rung in 58 of 60 simulated components
  against 25 of 60 for a perfect one, because a signal that sees less breaches less.
- For every one of the 8 detectors there is a cheap path: a change that lowers the failure_signal without
  lowering the failures it names. Five of them come from the siblings' own reports (lost single-turn
  sessions, lumped signatures, consistent misclassification, filing less, rubber-stamp review); three are
  derived here (a common-mode harness, a regression path made blind by a stricter
  filer, a canary seeded where it cannot reach). In a model of each, the cheap path lowers the primary
  metric in 8 of 8, and in 8 of 8 it buys at least as much as a real halving of the failure rate (within
  0.001), so the primary metric alone cannot tell gaming from improvement (VP 3).
- The declared companions do not close that gap. Two of the four are computable series in the model
  (#1396's non-filing counts and #1397's unmeasurable_share); under their own item's cheap path one moves
  (#1396) and one does not (#1397). #1398's stale_rung_days and #1399's withheld share read quantities the
  cheap path does not touch (section 2.3). #1394's c2 guard is static and, as its text reads, passes under
  lumping (inferred).
- A counter per detector does. Each register row names a counter series from a source other than the
  primary's own numerator: a recall measured on seeded known-positives (five rows), a coverage share
  (capture against an out-of-band session count; the canary against the columns it must reach), or a
  consistency check the producer cannot satisfy by misclassifying (deliberation). In the model each counter falls under its floor on the cheap path in 8 of 8 and holds at
  or above its floor on a real improvement in 8 of 8 (VP 3). That split is the register's job.
- Nothing reads any of this today. No file under src/ or scripts/ other than the pilot model and its
  evaluator names failure_signal or Goodhart, and none of the six telemetry contracts carries a field that
  marks a seeded (drill) row (VP 2).

Staged, not decided: one register row per detector (section 2.2) and one deterministic SQL per daily run
(section 2.4) that reads the register, a daily (primary, counter) series per detector and a drill log, and
returns one verdict per detector: ok, dark, breach, counter_dark, counter_low, undrilled, blind,
diverging, upstream_unsound or unregistered. A detector is ok only when its own signal, counter and drill
are sound and so is every detector upstream of it; a signal or drill row with no register row reads
unregistered. It passes 159/159 vectors with one row per detector, 49 by raising on malformed input; each of
246 mutants, named or from a rule sweep by class (comparisons, clauses, rounding and precision, tolerance,
aggregates, branch order, propagation, undefined days, half splits, params), fails at least one vector,
and three more are equivalent; and it reads both sides of every boundary grid correctly (520 recall pairs,
9,800 exact-eps moves; VP 4).
The maturity-ladder controller would read the verdict as an input; what a non-ok
verdict does to a rung is k1.

What is settled is narrow: a failure_signal per item and its Goodhart reading (pilot model code; Decision 196
clause 7 by analogy, section 3), the register's place in the data plane (Decision 209 clause 2(a)), and the
measured facts above. How a verdict acts on the ladder (k1), how drills run (k2), where counters are
declared (k3), harm weights (k4), the fixture's edge home (k5) and the divergence rule (k6) all weigh
credible alternatives with no admissible precedent: they are parked as asked. None touches IAM, security
or a governed deploy, and none decides spend: k2 (a) and the reviewer drill carry recurring cost, which the
cost/egress component owns (R4).

## 1. Evidence (each row re-derivable; VP step in brackets)

| id | fact | anchor |
|---|---|---|
| e1 | The eight sibling items, read at their pinned heads, carry 8 failure_signals; the register has one row per item and each row's metric equals the item's failure_signal.metric verbatim [VP 1] | the siblings and register blocks |
| e2 | 4 of 8 failure_signals name a companion read "beside" them (#1396, #1397, #1398, #1399); 1 of 8 names a seeded, canary, drill or injected known-positive (#1399) [VP 1] | sibling fixtures |
| e3 | In 7 of 8 items the spot_check -> anomaly_triggered trigger names the item's own failure_signal metric (#1390 reads "zero mismatches"); 0 of 8 such triggers names a recall or a drill [VP 1] | sibling fixtures |

| e5 | No file under src/ or scripts/ other than the pilot model and its evaluator names failure_signal or goodhart; the six telemetry contracts carry 0 synthetic or drill markers [VP 2] | repository grep |
| e6 | In the per-detector model, each cheap path lowers the primary (8/8) by at least as much as a real halving of the failure rate (8/8 within 0.001); each counter falls under its floor on the cheap path (8/8) and holds on the real improvement (8/8); 2 declared companions are computable and 1 of them moves [VP 3] | section 2.3 |
| e7 | The staged verdict SQL passes 159 vectors with one row per detector, 49 by raising with the stated message, and reads both sides of 520 exact recall boundaries and 9,800 exact-eps moves correctly [VP 4] | sections 2.4, 2.5 |
| e8 | Each of 246 mutants of the verdict SQL (34 named, 212 from the rule sweep) replaces one unique site and fails at least one vector; three further mutants are equivalent and listed apart [VP 4] | section 2.6 |
| e9 | #1398 (unmerged) measured that a half-blind monitor reaches the top rung in 58 of 60 components at a 5% error rate, against 25 of 60 at recall 1.0, and named reviewer error (R3) and unequal harm (R6) for this register | REPORT-w1-maturity-ladder.md section 0 and Risks, at f6183430 |
| e10 | Four sibling reports carry a Goodhart paragraph naming a cheap path and a guard (#1394, #1395, #1396, #1397); #1384 section 4 names its own blind spot; five (#1394-#1398) name what they hand to this register | sibling reports at the pinned heads |
| e11 | The producer writes a hook row's severity from its exit code: 2 is error, 0 or a missing code is info, anything else warning; an info row is outside unmapped_failure_share's denominator | src/turn_capture/observations.py:311 |
| e12 | Decision 73 halt check: the reader's named verb ci_rca_open returned [] at 2026-10-03T17:44:32Z | Step 0 |

Sibling heads read by VP 1 (pinned by sha, so a later push to a sibling branch does not change the reading):

### 1.1 What the inventory shows

Every sibling chose its failure_signal for a good reason; four wrote a Goodhart paragraph for it and a
fifth named its own blind spot.
What none of them can do from inside its own item is measure whether its signal still sees: a signal is
read by the same item whose output it judges, it is lower-is-better, and its top-rung trigger rewards a low
value. That is Goodhart's law in its regressional and adversarial forms at once (Manheim and Garrabrant's
taxonomy): optimisation pressure on a proxy selects for the proxy's blind spots, whether anyone intends it
or not. Most of the cheap paths below are not cheats. A single-turn session lost on reclaim, a rule that
grew too broad, a reviewer who got tired: each lowers a signal by accident, and the ladder then promotes on it.

The industry answers are old and consistent: pair every optimised metric with a guardrail metric that moves
the other way when the first is gamed (A/B-testing practice), measure a detector's recall by injecting
known faults rather than by waiting for real ones (fault injection, canary tokens, honeypots, seeded defects
in software inspection), and never let a monitor's own output be the only evidence that the monitor works.
This register applies those three to each W1 detector.

## 2. Register design (what this item stages)

### 2.1 What a register row answers

For each detector, five questions:

1. What decides on it (decides): the ladder's rungs for its own component, plus whatever the component
   itself gates (a proof close, a filing, an egress batch).
2. What its cheapest improvement is that does not reduce the failure it names (cheap_path).
3. What the item already declares against that (declared_guard), read from its own fixture and report.
4. A counter series from a source other than the primary's numerator, oriented higher-is-better in
   [0, 1], with a floor (counter, counter_floor). Independence is the point: a counter computed by the same
   code from the same rows as the primary inherits its blind spot (risk R2).
5. A drill: a seeded known-positive whose detection the verdict reads as recall (drill). Five rows' counters
   are themselves drill recalls; the other three (capture, deliberation, allow-list) carry a counter series
   and a separate drill.

Plus its upstream detectors: the components whose output feeds the primary's numerator or denominator. A
detector is no sounder than its inputs.

### 2.2 The register

Counter floors are seed values (q2), the same 0.99 for every row. Each row's breach threshold is the one its
own item's top-rung trigger already names (0.05 for capture, friction, rec filing and back-validation;
0.01 for deliberation; 0 for reader verbs and the canary; the AOQL target for the ladder, its q3); the
register reads those, it does not set them. That is staged, not settled: the thresholds sit in eight unmerged
PRs, one is provisional and one is an open question, and whether breach belongs in a soundness verdict at
all is k1 (v).

```yaml

### 2.3 Cheap-path scenarios (VP 3)

Each scenario is a small deterministic world (DuckDB, `range()` only, no randomness) built from the
detector's own definition of its primary metric. It is evaluated three ways: the baseline (`cheap=0,
better=0`); the cheap path (`cheap=1`), which in five rows hides half of the failures the detector sees and in
three applies the stated change (a min_sessions of 8 instead of 3 for rec filing and back-validation; the
canary seeded only into denied columns); and a real improvement (`better=1`) that halves the true failure
rate (for the canary, one of two leaking columns fixed) and leaves detection alone. Where seeded drill
rows appear (`drill`), they are excluded from the primary, as a build must exclude them (k2). The
claim is not the numbers, which are constructed: it is the direction of each counter under each world.

Two results matter. First, in five rows the cheap path and the real improvement give the same primary
(within 0.0006), and in three (rec filing, back-validation, allow-list) the cheap path looks better than the
real improvement: a ladder promoting on the primary prefers the gamed component. Second, every counter
separates the two worlds, and no declared companion does except #1396's run-record counts, which nothing
reads with a threshold.

### 2.4 The verdict (staged)

One SQL per daily run. Inputs (all build-time objects; q1): `{register}` one row per detector (detector,
threshold, counter_floor, drill_min, drill_recall_min, upstream); `{signal}` one row per detector per day
(primary_value and counter_value, each NULL when undefined, never NaN or infinite); `{drills}` one row per
drill run (detector, day, injected, detected). Params are data, stamped on every verdict record (seeds,
q2): a 28-day window read as two 14-day halves, eps 0.01 on each half-mean. The output is one row per
detector (VP 4 fails a repeated row: unsound_reads counts rows).

One rule governs history: every read of `{signal}` or `{drills}` goes through the window (`w`, `dw`: after
today minus 28 days, up to and including today), the guards included. Rows dated after today or before the
window are never read: history older than the window, malformed or not, neither reads unregistered nor
raises (v31, v32, v39, v40, v42-v44). The one exception is a row with a NULL day, which cannot be placed in
time, so it raises wherever it is (e16, e17).

Retiring or onboarding a detector never halts the run (staged; k2). An in-window signal or drill row whose
detector has no register row reads unregistered, the same for both tables (v24, v33, v60-v62): a detector
retired today keeps reading unregistered for 27 days, until its last row leaves the window, and a drill that
lands before its register row reads unregistered until the row exists. Under k1 (iii) as staged, an
unregistered row other than the register's own drill blocks every promotion, so a retirement freezes
promotion for those 27 days. The alternatives are k2's: a retired_on marker on the register row so its
in-window history still resolves, or a halt with a stated 28-day retirement procedure.

Malformed input raises instead of deciding (fail loud, Decision 55 by analogy). Register: a duplicate or
NULL detector, a NULL field, a non-finite threshold, a counter floor outside [0, 1] (NaN and infinities
included), drill_min below 1 (every row must be drilled), a recall floor outside (0, 1] (NaN included), an
upstream that names no register row, or an upstream cycle (self-loop included). Signal, in the window: a
NULL detector, a non-finite primary, a counter outside [0, 1] (section 2.1 orients every counter in [0, 1];
NaN and infinities included) or a duplicate day. Drills, in the window: a NULL field, a negative detected
count or more detected than injected. A sentinel row makes the guard fire even when no detector row would be
returned (e13, e24). Each range edge is pinned on both sides: the edge value itself is legal (v57, v64,
v65, v80) and a value 1e-7 past it raises (e40-e44). When several classes are malformed at once, the
outer CASE order decides the message: register, upstream, cycle, signal, drill (e46-e49).

Blast radius (staged; k2): any guard firing raises the whole run. So one malformed in-window row (a NaN
primary, a counter of 1.0000001, a duplicate detector-day, more detected than injected) suppresses every
detector's verdict, every day, until the row is corrected or leaves the window, up to 27 days later (e45:
X's one bad counter on day -20 halts A too). The [0, 1] counter guard widens this: an undercounting
out-of-band denominator now halts the register rather than reading ok for one detector. On a raised day
there is no verdict at all; staged, the ladder reads that as no promotion and no demotion for any detector
(every rung holds) and the run's error is the alarm. Decision 55 says fail loud, not fail wide, and is cited
only by analogy, so this is a choice, parked under k2 with its alternatives.

Staleness (staged; k1 (iv)): p_last and c_last are the latest defined values anywhere in the window,
however old, so a detector that last emitted 27 days ago decides on that value (v41); at 28 days it reads
dark. This fails open on the counter: a detector whose counter stops arriving keeps reading ok on its last
counter value for 27 days while its primary stays current (v63), and not emitting the counter is the
cheapest way to game it (R2). The latest value decides, not an extreme: a breach or a counter dip that
recovered inside the window does not count (v72, v76).
Each window edge is pinned: a drill dated today counts (v55) and one on the day the window opens does not
(v13); signal edges are v02 and v14.

Boundaries are exact to 9 decimal places, and each is pinned on both sides. Recall is read as detected /
injected against the floor; IEEE division is correctly rounded, so 7 of 25 at 0.28 meets it exactly (v34),
and 5e-7 under the floor is blind (v79); the legal edges drill_min 1, recall 1.0, a run that injected nothing
and one that detected nothing are pinned (v56-v59). A primary 1e-9 over its threshold breaches (v66) and a
counter 1e-9 under its floor is low (v67). For divergence, the late-half means and each eps-shifted bound
are rounded to 9 places before they are compared, so a fall of exactly eps is not diverging (v35, v38,
v51-v54), a fall larger than eps by 1e-8 is (v69, v70), and a fall larger than eps by 1e-11 is not (v81,
v82, v85, v86): that last pair is what "to 9 decimal places" means. Early means with 6- and 7-decimal
detail pin the bound's precision (v77, v78, v83, v84), and halves that are not constant pin the averages
against min, max and median (v73-v75, v87-v89). The early-half means are not rounded: the bound is rounded after the subtraction, so
rounding them changes nothing (verification r2's y12, y14 found no input that tells them apart). Each of
the four rounding sites is pinned on its own: one vector each (v51-v54) and one grid each. VP 4 checks
every (recall_min, injected) pair from 0.01-1.00 and 1-100 whose detected count is a whole number (520
pairs, 0 read blind; the multiplication form reads 13), every exact-eps fall on both series from 0.02-0.99
(9,604 detectors), and, because divergence needs both series, an exact-eps fall on one series while the
other falls clearly, from 0.02-0.99 on each side (98 and 98): 0 read diverging on all three, on every run.
Each grid has a near side too: one detected fewer reads blind for all 520 pairs, and a fall of eps + 1e-8
reads diverging for all 9,604, 98 and 98.
Without the rounding the counts are not even stable: over these grids DuckDB sums in parallel, so a
half-mean of equal values lands a few ulps either side from run to run. Removing any single rounding site
misread between 7 and 31 moves of its one-series grid across our runs, and removing all four misread 262
of the two-series grid on one run (1,450 with round 1's SQL).

The register's own drill injects one series a day whose name carries that day's date (drill-YYYY-MM-DD).
A day's drill passes only when that day's name reads unregistered. An earlier day's series still reads
unregistered inside the window (v33), so a fixed name would pass every day after the first, whether or not
the injection ran. The dated drill- series are excluded from the item's unsound_reads count. A detector's own non-ok verdict
outranks upstream_unsound (v23). breach outranks the counter, low or missing (v27, v100): a breach is
evidence the detector sees. A low counter outranks a missing drill (v28), too few faults outrank a low
recall on them (v101), and blind outranks diverging (v102), so each adjacent pair in the staged precedence
that can differ is pinned (k1 (ii)). Every non-ok upstream verdict propagates at full strength: dark,
breach, counter_dark, counter_low, undrilled, blind and diverging (v21, v90, v91, v92, v93, v20, v48; k1
(i)). Several detectors decide independently (v29). Inside a half-mean an undefined day is skipped, not read
as 0 (v96-v99), and each half starts and ends where stated (v37, v46, v94, v95). Params are read by name:
v103-v110 each override one param, so a build that reads eps_primary for eps_counter, or window_days as twice
half_days, fails a vector.

### 2.6 Mutants (VP 4)

Each mutant replaces one exact substring of the verdict SQL (it must occur exactly once) and must fail at
least one vector. m01-m34 are named. m35-m246 are a rule sweep, generated by class rather than by instance
after verification rounds 1-4 found survivors on sites mirroring killed ones. Its classes:

- every comparison flipped (< and <=, > and >=, = and <>);
- every OR or AND clause dropped, every CASE branch and every guard term dropped;
- every round() removed, and each re-rounded to 2, 4, 6 and 12 places;
- a tolerance of 1e-6 and 1e-3, in both directions, on every comparison against a DOUBLE (verdict and guard);
- every aggregate swapped: arg_max for arg_min, max and min; each half-mean avg for min, max and median;
  each drill sum for max and min;
- arithmetic: the eps sign, the recall division, the recursion step;
- every window bound and guard read widened to all history, and the mirror of each named mutant on the other
  series;
- the order of every WHEN in both CASEs: each adjacent pair swapped and each line moved to the top (the
  staged precedence of k1 (ii) and the error precedence);
- the propagation predicate narrowed to skip each upstream verdict in turn (the staged full strength of k1
  (i));
- an undefined day read as 0 inside each half-mean, and each half split moved a day either way;
- each param read as its sibling (eps_primary and eps_counter, window_days as twice half_days and half_days
  as half of window_days). Under the seed params these are equivalent, so a vector may override the params
  (v103-v110), as the build's versioned params will.

Each pass's survivors were either pinned by a new vector (v55-v59 legal edges; v66-v89 near sides,
precision and non-constant halves; e40-e44 range edges; v90-v110 and e46-e49 precedence, propagation,
undefined days, half splits and params) or, where no input could tell them apart, removed from the SQL as
redundant: a NULL-detector clause the duplicate count already catches, arg_max FILTERs
DuckDB's arg_max already applies, a negative-injected clause the detected clauses imply, the early-half
rounding, and the non-finite checks on the counter and its floor that the [0, 1] range already makes. One
Three mutants stay equivalent and are listed apart. q01: reading the reach depth bound inclusively only
lets the recursion run one step further, and a path that long already contains a cycle the guard catches
(verification r3 checked it on every graph of 1-3 detectors and 400 random graphs of 4-5). q02 and q03:
swapping dark with breach, or counter_dark with counter_low, cannot change a verdict, because when the
latest value is NULL the comparison in the other branch is NULL too. Three further equivalents the
verifiers found by the same arguments are not generated by the sweep: a recursion base depth of 0, `s JOIN
dr` read as a LEFT JOIN, and the coalesce on detected dropped (detected is NULL only when injected is 0,
which reads undrilled first). VP 4 counts the kills and the unique sites; the table lists
every killing vector.

## 3. Settled / contested / risk / open

### Settled (fixture s1-s3)

- **s1.** Every pilot item carries exactly one failure_signal, and that signal is where its Goodhart
  question is answered. Precedent: the pilot model requires a failure_signal and the evaluator's L1 keeps
  it unique per item (merged code, CD.45 W0, operator-approved 2026-10-02); Decision 196 clause 7 asks the same question of
  Tier A decisions and is used only by analogy. Data plane only: the register reads the customer's own
  telemetry and review rows (Decision 209 clause 2(a)); whether any verdict crosses is #1399's k1.
- **s2.** Measured: in 8 of 8 W1 items a stated cheap path lowers the failure_signal at least as far as a
  real halving of failures, and the staged counter separates the two in 8 of 8 (VP 3).
- **s3.** Measured: 4 of 8 failure_signals name a companion, 1 a seeded known-positive, 0 a recall check on
  the top-rung trigger; the companions computable in the model catch 1 of 2 cheap paths (VP 1, VP 3).

### Contested (k1-k3 in the fixture; k4-k6 report-only, the fixture's contested list is capped at 3)

- **k1 (asked). What a non-ok verdict does on the ladder.** (a) It blocks promotion and demotes one rung,
  as #1398's staged dark-signal leg does (its k7 (a)). (b) It blocks promotion only; the rung holds. (c) Advisory: logged beside the
  transition record, nothing gates. Recommended (a) for dark, blind, undrilled, counter_dark, counter_low
  and unregistered, and (b) for diverging and upstream_unsound, which are weaker evidence. For dark, (a) is
  the action #1398's own dark-signal leg already takes, so the register adds a reading, not a second
  demotion. For breach, the recommendation is to drop the leg (v below); while it stays, (b) for the
  breaching detector only. #1398 measured that
  a half-blind monitor also lets more errors escape below the top rung (2.09% on its worst seed), so
  blocking promotion alone leaves that. No Decision or contract decides it; #1398 is unmerged and its own
  k1 and k7 are parked. Two choices inside the staged SQL belong to this fork and are not decided:
  (i) propagation strength: any non-ok upstream, diverging included, propagates upstream_unsound at full
  strength, where the alternatives are to propagate only the strong verdicts or to carry a weaker grade;
  (ii) precedence: breach before the counter, counter_low before undrilled, and a detector's own verdict
  before upstream, which decides the single verdict a detector with several faults reports, and so which
  action fires. (iii) What the ladder does with an unregistered row, which has no rung of its own to
  demote: staged, the ladder ignores rows whose detector is a dated drill- series (the register's own
  drill, as unsound_reads does) and blocks every promotion while any other unregistered row exists, so a
  retired detector freezes promotion for 27 days (v61); the alternative is to treat it as a register defect
  for the operator and block nothing. (iv) Staleness: staged, the latest defined value anywhere in the
  window decides p_last and c_last (v41), which fails open on a counter that stops arriving (v63); the
  alternative is a freshness bound (for example counter_dark when no counter arrived in the last 2 days),
  which needs a per-detector cadence. (v) The breach leg. Staged: each row's threshold is borrowed from
  its item's own top-rung trigger (section 2.2), so it rests on eight unmerged PRs, one marked provisional
  and one, #1398's AOQL target, its open q3; a latest primary above it reads breach, a non-ok verdict that
  propagates downstream at full strength (v90). As staged, the ladder's row cannot be loaded until #1398 q3
  is answered, and loaded with a NULL threshold it raises the whole run (plan-critique r1, S1). One capture
  reading of 0.06 on every day makes 7 of the 8 detectors read unsound although capture's counter and drill
  are sound (S3). A breach is component health, not a Goodhart unsoundness. Alternatives: (a) a
  register-owned threshold the operator sets per row; (b) no breach leg, so the register reads soundness
  only and component health stays with each item's own top-rung trigger; (c) keep the leg but do not
  propagate breach. Recommended (b): it removes the #1398 q3 dependency and the S3 fan-out, and the ladder
  already reads each item's own trigger. All five stay as staged until k1 is answered. Consequence to
  weigh: capture's counter needs its q1 out-of-band denominator, which
  does not exist, so under (a) or (b) capture reads counter_dark from day one and every detector downstream
  reads upstream_unsound until it lands (risk R6).
- **k2 (asked). How drills run.** (a) Live: seeded rows written through the real producers under a
  dedicated drill project_id, excluded from every consumer total by that id (the pattern #1390's report
  records for rec-4025's T3.2 assert over a synthetic project_id). (b) Replay: each detector's SQL run
  offline over seeded rows, never touching production tables. (c) Operator-labelled samples only. Recommended
  (b) for the six SQL detectors and (a) only for capture and the canary, whose failures live in the
  pipeline, not in the SQL. (a) needs every consumer to exclude the drill project_id (no contract field marks
  a drill row today, e5); (b) cannot see a live-pipeline loss, which is why capture's counter is an
  out-of-band count. The ladder's reviewer drill (known-wrong outputs in the review sample) is a choice about
  the operator's own review stream and sits inside this fork. So does how the register's own drill stays
  live: staged, one dated drill- series a day read over the 28-day window (section 2.4); the alternative is a
  today-only unregistered read. Build note: the ladder and unsound_reads should ignore only the run's own
  exact drill-YYYY-MM-DD, not every name with the drill- prefix, or a register row named drill-% should
  raise, so no real detector can hide in that namespace (plan-critique r1 N1). So does retirement and
  onboarding: staged, in-window signal and drill rows of
  a detector with no register row both read unregistered, so neither halts the run (v60-v62); the
  alternatives are a retired_on marker on the register row, so in-window history still resolves, or a halt
  with a stated 28-day retirement procedure. So does the blast radius of malformed input: staged, any guard
  firing raises the whole run, suppressing every detector's verdict for up to 27 days (e45), and the ladder
  holds every rung on a day without verdicts. The alternatives: (a) a per-detector malformed verdict for
  signal and drill defects, keeping the whole-run raise for register defects only; (b) quarantine the
  offending row and read the rest; (c) keep the halt with a stated repair procedure (correct or delete the
  row). Only Decision 55, by analogy, bears on it, and it asks for loud failure, not wide failure.
- **k3 (asked). Where counters and drills are declared.** (a) In this item's register rows only (staged).
  (b) Two new FailureSignal fields, counter and drill, on every pilot item, with the evaluator requiring them
  (a pilot-schema change, the evaluator owner's, O1). (c) In each item's prose. Recommended (a) now and (b) at
  lift, so a detector cannot be added without its counter. (b) touches the evaluator, which a design slice may
  not change.
- **k4 (asked; report-only). Harm weights** (#1398 R6). (a) Uniform: every detector's verdict counts the
  same. (b) Per-detector weights the operator sets, read by the ladder's AOQL target. (c) Derived from what the
  detector gates: an egress or a proof close above a filing above a label. Recommended (c) as the starting
  order, set by the operator. No precedent.
- **k5 (asked; report-only). The fixture item's edge home.** (a) depends_on T2.36 only (carried
  provisionally): the signals and drills are telemetry reader rows. (b) part_of T3.4, beside the maturity
  ladder, whose exit criterion 2 asks for gates with rollback. (c) part_of T3.3, whose false-positive
  threshold (audit F-035) is one of these rows. Recommended (a) until W2 places the ladder.
- **k6 (asked; report-only). The divergence rule.** (a) Half-window means with an absolute eps on each
  (staged; v15-v19). (b) A per-row statistical test on both series (for example a two-proportion test at a
  stated alpha), which needs per-day denominators. (c) No divergence leg; the counter floor alone. Recommended
  (a) for the pilot: it is one comparison and fails toward review, and (b) once denominators are recorded.
  (c) misses slow drift above the floor (v15 is above its floor). Under (a) the boundary arithmetic is
  staged exact to 9 decimal places (recall by division, 9-place rounding, section 2.4); the alternative is to
  state both rules as approximate. Recall is pooled over the window (v30: drills sum across it); the
  alternative is a per-run recall floor, which R5's small counts make noisier. Staleness moved to k1 (iv):
  it decides p_last and c_last, not the divergence rule.

### Risks

- **R1 Teaching to the drill.** A rule set, a model or a person that can tell drill rows from real ones
  can pass every drill and still miss real faults. Drills must be drawn from the real distribution and
  rotated, and no detector rule may branch on the drill marker (the exclusion happens after detection).
- **R2 Counters can be gamed too.** A counter computed from the same rows by the same code as the primary
  shares its blind spot (a second-order Goodhart). Each row's counter source is chosen to be independent of
  the primary's numerator; the build's c2 replay checks the counter moves, not that it is independent.
- **R3 Drill rows in the warehouse.** Under k2 (a), a consumer that forgets the drill project_id counts
  seeded failures as real. No contract field marks a drill row (e5).
- **R4 Cost.** Drills are runs, and the reviewer drill adds review items. Both are recurring cost, owned by
  the cost/egress component; no fork here decides spend.
- **R5 Small counts.** drill_min 20 per 28 days is under one fault a day; a recall floor of 0.9 over 20
  faults passes a 90%-recall detector only about two times in three (#1398 measured 68%). Seeds, q2.
- **R6 A dark root freezes the loop.** Propagation is fail-safe by design: when capture is not ok, nothing
  downstream promotes. Until capture's q1 denominator exists that is every day (k1). A breaching root does
  the same on an ordinary bad day for a working detector: one capture reading of 0.06 freezes 7 of 8 (k1
  (v)).
- **R7 The model is a model.** Section 2.3's worlds are deterministic and built from each sibling's own
  definitions; they show directions, not rates. The build's c2 replays each cheap path on the real metric.

### Open questions (q1-q3 in the fixture)

- **q1.** Where the out-of-band counts and drill logs live: capture's q1 session denominator, rec-4025's
  harness widened to shadow mode (#1390 q2, a queue change for the operator), the friction label review
  (#1394 q2), and the verdict log itself (shares #1398 q2 and #1396 q4).
- **q2.** Seeds are unmeasured: counter floor 0.99, drill_min 20 per 28 days at recall 0.9, eps 0.01 on
  14-day halves. Who sets per-detector values, and from what measurement?
- **q3.** Is the register's verdict one input to #1398's controller, replacing its top-rung drill with a
  drill at every rung (its k5 (a3)), or does the controller keep its own drill and read the register
  beside it? This report reads one input.

### Named for owners, not filed (Decision 67)

- **O1** The pilot FailureSignal model has no counter or drill field (e4), so no item can declare its guard
  in a form the evaluator checks (evaluator owner; k3 (b)).
- **O2** A hook row with no integer exit code is written severity info (e11), so a hook that fails without
  reporting a code leaves unmapped_failure_share's denominator. Whether Claude Code omits exitCode on a hook
  timeout is not verified here (inferred; telemetry producer owner).
- **O3** No telemetry contract carries a field that marks a seeded drill row (e5); a live drill (k2 (a))
  needs one, or a reserved project_id with an exclusion rule every consumer honours (telemetry contract owner).

## 4. Consideration register (as authored in the fixture)

- why: all 8 W1 failure_signals are lower-is-better and each has a cheap path that lowers it as far as a
  real halving of failures (VP 3); 4 name a companion, 1 a seeded positive, 0 a recall check (VP 1).
- how: one register row per detector (metric, cheap path, counter, drill, upstreams) and one daily SQL that
  returns one of ten verdicts per detector; the ladder reads it (k1).
- planes: data_plane.
- maturity (thresholds are provisional seeds; plan fork line): read_all, the operator re-derives every
  verdict; to sampled after 40 verdicts re-derived unchanged since the last overturned one; to spot_check
  after 40 more on a 1-in-5 sample; to anomaly_triggered after 30 consecutive days in which the register's
  own drill (one injected unregistered series a day, named for that day) reads unregistered. The return leg and version rule are
  #1398's k1 and k2.
- failure_signal: a detector reads sound while it is not. Metric unsound_reads: series that reached the
  ladder with no register row, plus register rows whose counter held over its floor in their own cheap-path
  replay; must be 0. Source: the verdict log (unregistered rows other than the dated drill- series) and the
  c2 replay run on every register version.
- verification: c1 vectors, c2 cheap-path replay per row, c3 operator review of every register row.
- rollback: stop the verdict schedule; the ladder reads its other inputs as before; register rows and drill
  logs stay as history.

## 5. Boundary notes for W2 synthesis

- **Maturity ladder (#1398).** The register's verdict is one series with the controller's inputs: the
  failure_signal it reads per component must be the register row's metric (that report's own boundary note).
  Contradiction for W2: #1398 stages a drill at spot_check only (its k5 (a)) and names a drill at every rung
  as a candidate cure (its k5 (a3)); this register stages a drill verdict at every rung. W2 picks one home.
  R3 (reviewer error) and R6 (harm weights) from that report are rows 7 and k4 here.
- **Capture (#1384).** Its q1 out-of-band denominator is this register's capture counter; until it exists,
  capture is counter_dark and the whole loop is upstream_unsound (R6). W2 should sequence q1 first.
- **Reader verbs (#1390).** Its q2 (rec-4025 widened to shadow mode) is the source of the reader counter;
  "no" leaves that row undrilled.
- **Friction (#1394).** Its c2 guard and this row's drill are complementary: c2 stops wildcards statically,
  the drill catches lumping under an exact signature. O2 is a producer rule in its slice 3b.
- **Deliberation (#1395).** This row adds the read-side arm its report says is missing (none with
  reasoning tokens) as a counter, not as a fourth drift kind; W2 may move it into the drift monitor.
- **Rec filing (#1396) and back-validation (#1397).** They share one cheap path: a stricter filer improves
  both metrics at once. Their drills are one seeded recurring finding read twice (filed; then, after a drill
  no-op close, re-filed as a regression).
- **Allow-list (#1399).** Canary coverage is a property of the seeding, not of the egress: the canary row
  must be read back from the data-plane input each run. Register verdicts are data-plane only; any fleet
  view of them crosses only through #1399's allow-list (its k1, always-ask).
- **Cost/egress (component 10).** Drills and the reviewer drill are recurring cost; under k2 (b) they run
  offline in the data plane.
- **Upstream graph.** The register's upstream lists are the data edges W2 should author as pilot
  depends_on edges between items; the evaluator's L4 refuses an edge to a pilot item absent from this
  branch's fixture, so none is added here.

## 6. Staged candidate decision text (for W3; not filed)

This text presumes the recommended options of parked forks k1, k2 and k3. It is not settled.

> "A loop detector's failure_signal promotes nothing on its own. Every detector whose series gates an
> automated transition carries a register row naming the cheapest way its metric improves without the work
> improving, a counter series from a source independent of the metric's numerator, and a seeded drill
> that measures its recall. A daily deterministic verdict reads the register, the series and the drill
> log; a detector is sound only when its signal is present, its counter and drill are sound, and so are its
> upstream detectors. An unsound verdict blocks promotion; a dark, blind, undrilled, counter_dark,
> counter_low or unregistered verdict also demotes one rung, while diverging and upstream_unsound only
> block. A series without a register row is unsound by definition. Whether a detector breached its own
