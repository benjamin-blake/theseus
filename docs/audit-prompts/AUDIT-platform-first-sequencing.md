# AUDIT: Platform-First Sequencing Frame

You are a frontier-grade reviewer running a single, self-contained audit in a fresh session.
This file is your complete brief. Do NOT ask clarifying questions -- every term, path, enum, and
degraded path you need is pinned below. Execute it verbatim.

## 1. TASK

Audit the **platform-first sequencing frame**: the operating directive that all of one
developer-agent's build capacity goes to closing the platform's autonomous loop **before** any
trading-product-plane work begins. The platform roadmap is active; the product roadmap was dormant
(`status: draft`) and has since been retired from the repository.

This is a **premise / governance audit, not a code audit**. You will read decision records,
roadmap artifacts, framing docs, and the controls that operate around them, and you will judge
whether the sequencing is a sound, conscious, reversible choice -- or an inherited premise that
should be examined and either ratified or changed.

You will answer six questions (Q1..Q6, Section 7), rate a rubric (Section 8), and adjudicate a
set of candidate observations to findings. You will produce **exactly two deliverable files**:
`audits/platform-first-sequencing-<sha>.yaml` (system of record) and
`audits/platform-first-sequencing-<sha>.md` (executive report, <= ~1500 words). The ONLY files
you create or modify in the repository tree are those two. You draft; **the human disposes** --
nothing you recommend takes effect until a human executes it.

**Framing you must hold throughout:** "unratified" is NOT a synonym for "wrong." An inherited
frame can be entirely correct. The two equally-valid classes of outcome are (a) recommend
changing the sequencing, and (b) recommend ratifying the current sequencing as a conscious,
reversal-conditioned decision. A run that arrives at (b) with rigor is exactly as successful as
one that arrives at (a). Do not let the observation "it was never ratified" pull you toward a
resequence verdict.

## 2. CANDIDATE OBSERVATIONS vs VERDICTS

This prompt hands you **facts** and **candidate hypotheses**. It hands you **no verdicts**. Every
observation in the GROUNDING MAP (Section 10) is stated as a neutral fact; every candidate in
Section 9 is a hypothesis you must trace and adjudicate. **ASSUME NO CANDIDATE IS A REAL DEFECT
UNTIL YOU TRACE IT.** A run that merely confirms the candidates below has failed.

Per-candidate adjudication enum, and where each outcome lands in the output:

- **CONFIRMED-gap** (the premise is genuinely unexamined/unsound in the way described, traced to
  file:line or artifact): -> `findings[]`, `roadmap_crossref.classification: novel`.
- **partially-owned** (an existing artifact touches it but its treatment is insufficient or the
  remedy is unbuilt): -> `findings[]`, classification `planned-insufficient` or
  `planned-unbuilt`, naming the owning artifact.
- **fully-covered** (an existing Decision / roadmap item / control adequately handles it): ->
  `rejected_candidates[]`, naming the compensating control and why it property-matches.
- **not-a-gap** (the frame is sound on this axis; the observation carries no defect): ->
  `rejected_candidates[]`.

Severity is assigned by you AFTER judgment (Section 15), never inherited from this prompt's
framing or ordering.

## 3. READ FIRST -- DISAMBIGUATION TRAPS

Five hazards where a plausible misread will waste the session. Internalize before reading
anything else.

1. **Decision 93 is NOT the ratifying decision.** Decision 93 ("Platform-MVP boundary +
   deferred_post_mvp lifecycle status", `docs/DECISIONS.md:1286`) defines *what counts as
   platform-MVP* (the autonomous loop closing) plus a defer-by-exception rule. It merely *cites*
   the platform-first directive as a given ("per the platform-first directive",
   `docs/DECISIONS.md:1311`, `:1315`). It is **evidence the directive is unratified** (used, never
   decided), not its ratification. Do not treat Decision 93 as the conscious sequencing decision.

2. **Two distinct "MVP"s.** *Platform-MVP* (Decision 93: the loop closes with no human in the
   critical path) is different from the product *"minimum viable trading system v1"* (the pivot
   transcript's Part C; the `MVP.*` items in the retired product roadmap). This audit is about
   sequencing *between the two planes*, NOT about the internal definition of either MVP.

3. **The executor freeze (Decision 67 / CD.17) is NOT the sequencing frame.** The freeze is a
   trigger-gated pause on executor *operation* and STRATEGIC-plan *authoring*. It is a downstream
   mechanism, not the allocation frame. "Executor frozen" does not mean "product work frozen" --
   different cause. The adjacent mvp-triage audit established the freeze does not block platform
   *construction*. Do not conflate the two; do not reopen the freeze.

4. **plan-critique's "Frame Challenge" is a plan-time control, not a portfolio-allocation
   control.** Phase 2b (`.claude/skills/plan-critique/SKILL.md:69`) challenges a *single plan's*
   frame against *existing* Decisions / roadmap / North Star, and recommends REVISE only on a
   concrete contradiction with a recorded artifact. Consider carefully whether it can, even in
   principle, challenge the sequencing frame itself -- given that the frame is the unwritten
   baseline it checks *against*. Reach your own conclusion; do not assume either way.

5. **The pivot "transcript" is an audit-prompt file.** The pivot-era product rationale lives
   embedded in a since-retired audit-prompt file's Section 11 (referenced throughout
   the retired product roadmap as "PIVOT Part A..G"). Parts B/D/F were noted as "user questions
   only". There is no clean standalone "pivot decision" doc.
   **You must check whether Section 11 weighs platform-vs-product timing at all** -- if it does,
   that materially changes Q1's provenance answer. Do not presume the sequencing rationale is
   absent there without reading it.

## 4. SCOPE

**In scope -- surfaces (all are text/design; nothing executes):**

| Surface id | What it is | State |
|---|---|---|
| `sequencing-frame` | The governance object: is platform-before-product a conscious, reversible decision? | Built-as-text (Decisions, framing docs) |
| `product-loop-feasibility` | The dormant product plane's readiness to host an interleaved minimal loop | Designed-unbuilt (retired product roadmap + scaffold code) |

**Vocabulary (pinned):**
- *The frame / the sequencing frame* = strict platform-before-product sequencing of one agent's
  build capacity.
- *The alternative / interleaved minimal product loop* = an L1+L3 slice (alpha signal ->
  execution) run under **human operations** as paper/manual trading, with **no dependency on the
  frozen autonomous executor**, interleaved with continued platform work.
- *Platform-MVP boundary* (Decision 93) = one autonomous-loop iteration closes with no human in
  the critical path.
- *The planes*: **platform plane** = infra/governance/automation substrate (ROADMAP-PLATFORM);
  **product / trading plane** = the four-layer trading model (retired product roadmap).
- *Four layers*: L1 Alpha / L2 Portfolio-Construction / L3 Execution / L4 Operations-Telemetry.
- *frame-lock* (Decision 75) = a named architectural-planning failure mode: an inherited frame
  from an earlier era silently constrains every subsequent choice; nobody re-asks the framing
  question when the tool/context has moved.
- *defer-by-exception* (Decision 93) = MVP-critical by default; items leave scope only by
  conscious deferral; the MVP set is never enumerated.
- *reversal condition* = a stated, observable trigger under which a decision is revisited.

**Out of scope (name in one line; do not opine):**
- The trading product *architecture* itself -- the four-layer model, MVP-v1 composition (settled
  in the pivot transcript).
- The product *code surface* audited to file:line already (wave-1 code-surface audit).
- Whether the platform-MVP boundary definition (Decision 93) is right -- it stands.
- The executor freeze mechanism and its reversal gates (Decision 67 / CD.17).

**Trust-nothing clause:** obtain every file / line / size by reading the file. Trust no number
quoted here; re-derive it from the repo. Record any anchor that does not resolve (or that
`origin/main` has moved off) in `meta.stale_anchors` and proceed on the re-derived truth.

## 5. SETUP

You may run read-only commands to orient and to regenerate local caches. Permitted setup:

```
git fetch origin main
git rev-parse --short origin/main      # this sha feeds filenames, branch, meta.audited_commit
bin/venv-python -m scripts.session_preflight --roadmap-detail full   # populates local caches
```

The preflight populates `logs/.preflight-report.json` and `logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl`
(read-only caches; regenerating them is expected and does NOT breach the write boundary -- never
commit them).

**Degraded path (preflight fails for ANY reason -- creds, egress, an unrecognized flag, a bug):**
do NOT abort. Set `meta.degraded_dedup=true`, mark every finding's `roadmap_crossref.confidence`
as `HYPOTHESIS` and every `dedup_hit_count` as `null`, and proceed using direct `grep`/`rg` over
the in-repo files named in Section 13 (those are on-disk and need no credentials or preflight).
The audit's core judgment does not depend on warehouse reads or on the preflight succeeding.

**Degraded path (remote unreachable):** if `git fetch origin main` fails, fall back to the local
checkout: use `git rev-parse --short HEAD` for the `<sha>`, and in Section 16 branch off local
`HEAD` instead of `origin/main` (`git switch -c audit/platform-first-sequencing-<sha> HEAD`).
Still write, commit, and (if the push/PR path is reachable) push and open the PR. If push or
`create_pull_request` is ALSO unreachable, stop after the local commit and record
`meta.contract_notes: "remote unreachable; base=local HEAD; PR not opened -- push and open
manually"`. Do not abort and do not skip writing the deliverables.

**Confidence-downgrade scope:** `degraded_dedup` downgrades ONLY the `roadmap_crossref`
confidence and `dedup_hit_count`. A finding's own `confidence` and `sequencing_verdict.frame`'s
`confidence` follow their normal rule (Section 14): `CONFIRMED` iff traced to a file:line or a
sampled artifact -- which grep over on-disk files still supports even with warehouse reads down.

## 6. NORTH STAR

The bar you judge each surface against. These are judgment-bearing principles, not mechanical
rules -- argue each surface against them; do not pattern-match.

- **NS-A (Conscious allocation):** consequential capacity-allocation choices should be *conscious
  decisions* with recorded alternatives, not premises inherited by default. (This is Decision
  75's own bar and the spirit of defer-by-exception.)
- **NS-B (Frames re-validate when premises move):** an inherited frame from a superseded era must
  be re-examined when its premises change. (Decision 75 mitigations 4-5.)
- **NS-C (Challengeable frames):** a standing control should be able to challenge the frame it
  operates within; a frame that no owned surface can question is a governance gap.
- **NS-D (Reversal triggers over silent renewal):** an opportunity-cost bet that compounds each
  period should carry an explicit reversal/review trigger, so it is re-chosen consciously rather
  than renewed by inertia.
- **NS-E (Load-bearing premises get tested):** the alpha premise (that the strategy has edge) is
  load-bearing for the whole endeavor; leaving it untested until the platform is finished is a
  risk concentration that should be a conscious, argued choice -- not a side effect of sequencing.

These are a bar you judge against, not absolutes: a surface can fall short of one and still be
the right call if you argue the tradeoff.

## 7. THE QUESTIONS

Answer each in `question_answers[]` with its pinned verdict enum, a `basis` list of finding ids,
and prose. Every question is first-class.

- **Q1 -- Provenance.** Is platform-first sequencing a ratified decision, an inherited
  (unratified) premise, or a frame-lock instance by Decision 75's structural test? Trace where
  (if anywhere) the sequencing was weighed -- including the pivot transcript Section 11 (trap 5).
  Verdict enum: `ratified | inherited-unratified | frame-locked`.
- **Q2 -- Alternative feasibility & cost.** Is the interleaved minimal manual/paper product loop
  (L1+L3 under human ops, no executor) feasible given today's scaffold state, and what would it
  cost to stand up and to run? Ground the feasibility in the actual current_state of the product
  code. **Pin the cost in these units:** the sole operator's one-time setup effort and recurring
  attention (hours/week), plus calendar time -- NOT agent/executor compute capacity. Verdict
  enum: `feasible-low-cost | feasible-high-cost | infeasible`.
- **Q3 -- Feedback value vs delay risk.** Net, does interleaving the minimal loop now generate
  more value (real trading telemetry feeding the T2.36/T3.x chain; TCA/cost data; alpha-premise
  validation) than it costs in platform delay? **Frame the scarce resource correctly:** this is a
  sole-developer system and the executor is frozen (not consuming agent capacity), so the binding
  constraint on both planes is the *operator's own attention*. "Platform delay" therefore means
  operator attention diverted from platform work plus calendar slip -- not lost compute. Weigh the
  telemetry/alpha-validation payoff against that attention cost and against CAND-E's compounding
  argument. Verdict enum: `interleave-favored | sequencing-favored | too-close-to-call`.
- **Q4 -- Reversal condition.** Is there any observable condition under which strict sequencing
  should stop, and is such a condition recorded anywhere today? Verdict enum:
  `defined | undefined-should-exist | not-needed`.
- **Q5 -- Disposition (owns the decision block).** Given Q1-Q4, what should happen to the frame?
  Verdict enum: `ratify_as_is | ratify_with_reversal_conditions | resequence_interleaved |
  insufficient_evidence`. Its prose entry points to the `sequencing_verdict.frame` block
  (Section 14). All four options are first-class; `insufficient_evidence` is a legitimate,
  non-cowardly verdict if the evidence genuinely does not discriminate.
- **Q6 -- Questions the requester did not think to ask.** Use the
  `question_answers` final-entry shape (`answers: [{question, answer, basis}]`). Answer all three
  seeds below, then ADD at least two of your own (cap ~5 additional -- precision over volume):
  - What is the marginal cost of a human-run paper loop measured in the *operator's attention*
    (the binding resource), and how does that compare to the operator attention strict sequencing
    frees or consumes? Argue both directions; do not presume the loop is near-free.
  - Does "zero telemetry captured" (rec-2173) mean the platform's own recursive-improvement loop
    is *also* currently starved -- i.e., is the platform bet itself iterating blind while it
    waits for synthetic loop traffic?
  - Is there a third option beyond interleave-vs-sequence (e.g., a time-boxed sequencing with a
    hard review date, which is exactly `ratify_with_reversal_conditions`) that dominates both?

## 8. RUBRIC

Rate each dimension per surface in `rubric_ratings[]`. Enum: `strong | adequate | weak | absent |
n/a`. `n/a` is correct and costless where a dimension does not structurally apply to a surface --
never manufacture a rating or a finding to fill a cell. **Row cardinality:** emit exactly one row
per dimension on its primary surface (5 rows minimum, VD1..VD5); add a second row for a dimension
on the other surface ONLY when you have a substantive reason to rate it there (so 5-10 rows
total). Each dimension below names its primary surface.

- **VD1 Decision provenance** (S1 `sequencing-frame`): is the sequencing recorded as a conscious
  choice with alternatives? Serves Q1.
- **VD2 Reversal/review trigger** (S1): is there an observable end-condition, versus silent
  period-over-period renewal? Serves Q4.
- **VD3 Frame-challengeability** (S1): can any owned control question the frame? Serves Q1, Q6.
- **VD4 Alternative-costed** (S2 `product-loop-feasibility`): is the interleaved loop's
  feasibility and cost actually assessed anywhere, or only asserted? Serves Q2.
- **VD5 Feedback-value vs delay-risk weighed** (S2): is the telemetry / alpha-validation payoff
  weighed against the platform-delay cost, where delay cost is correctly framed as the sole
  operator's diverted attention (not compute)? Serves Q3.

## 9. CANDIDATE OBSERVATIONS (adjudicate each; do not assume)

Each is a hypothesis. Trace it; it may confirm, split, or be rejected. **These candidates are NOT
balanced by construction:** CAND-A..D probe for *gaps* in the current frame; CAND-E probes the
*affirmative case* for it. Do NOT read the 4:1 count as a directional signal -- it reflects that
the request arrived phrased as a gap, not that the frame is likely wrong. You MUST build a
standalone affirmative trace for strict sequencing (its compounding platform benefit AND the
alternative's costs) with the SAME rigor you apply to the gap hypotheses, and weigh both before
Q5. Give the status quo an argued defense; do not let the richly-specified alternative win by
elaboration alone.

- **CAND-A (provenance):** the sequencing is an unratified inherited premise, possibly a
  frame-lock per Decision 75 -- never recorded as a conscious decision with examined
  alternatives. *Counter-check:* read the pivot transcript Section 11 for any weighing of
  platform-vs-product timing; if present, CAND-A weakens or splits.
- **CAND-B (reversal):** no reversal or review condition exists for the sequencing, so each
  period silently re-makes the opportunity-cost bet. *Counter-check:* search Decisions / roadmap
  for any time-box, review date, or trigger tied to product activation.
- **CAND-C (challengeability):** no owned surface can challenge the frame; plan-critique's Frame
  Challenge operates strictly inside it. *Counter-check:* does any workflow, scheduled agent, or
  audit cadence have the frame itself in scope?
- **CAND-D (alternative uncosted):** an interleaved minimal product loop is feasible and would
  feed real telemetry / validate alpha, and this tradeoff has never been costed. *Counter-check:*
  ground feasibility in the product current_state (some surfaces are absent, not merely
  scaffolded -- an L1+L3 paper loop may need more than the trigger implies); search for any prior
  costing.
- **CAND-E (the frame is the correct call):** strict sequencing is sound because the platform's
  recursive-improvement machinery compounds -- finishing it first multiplies the productivity of
  all later product work -- while an interleaved human-run loop imposes real, recurring cost on
  the **sole operator's attention** (the actual binding resource; see Q3), fragments focus, and
  risks half-finishing both planes. Under this hypothesis the right output is
  `ratify_as_is` or `ratify_with_reversal_conditions`, not a resequence. *Counter-check:* is the
  compounding benefit actually load-bearing on the near-term critical path, or is the platform
  already far enough along that the marginal compounding is small? Is the operator demonstrably
  attention-constrained, or is the frozen executor freeing capacity that a paper loop could use
  at low marginal cost? Trace both directions; do not assume CAND-E is true any more than A..D.

## 10. GROUNDING MAP

This map spends your cognition on judgment, not grep. Every anchor was read from disk at compose
time; **re-verify each before relying on it** (trust-nothing clause) and record drift in
`meta.stale_anchors`. Facts are stated neutrally -- no adjective here implies a verdict.

**The frame's articulation points:**
- `docs/DECISIONS.md:1286-1323` -- Decision 93. The phrase "platform-first directive" occurs at
  `:1311` and `:1315`, each as "per the platform-first directive", parking product-facing edges
  dormant. No `## Decision` header in the file ratifies platform-vs-product sequencing.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md:2034+` -- Decision 75, "Frame-Lock Anti-Pattern in Architectural Planning":
  names the failure mode and defines the plan-critique Frame Challenge mitigation and its five
  questions (`:2056-2060`), including "what assumption from an earlier decision are we still
  carrying that the world has moved past?"
- `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md:313-469` -- "Platform End-State": frames the destination as the
  four-tier workflow closing "with no human in the critical path of one iteration"; the product
  roadmap is named the "sibling product axis" (`:319`). No sequencing rationale is stated.

**The dormant product plane:**
- The retired product roadmap -- `status: draft`; `:21` `filed_via: pending_log_decision_lambda`.
  (Note: the file's own header comment at `:11-15` says validation is "deferred ... not
  Pydantic-validated", but that comment is stale -- `scripts/product_roadmap.py` DOES exist and
  `scripts/checks/roadmap/validate_product_roadmap.py` Pydantic-validates this file in
  `validate.py`'s `--pre` tier (`validate.py:200`, `_ROADMAP_YAML_PATHS`). The product roadmap is
  dormant by `status`, not by lack of validation. Re-verify this on disk.)
- The retired product roadmap's `current_state`: "Data plane is production-grade; trading
  plane is mostly scaffold or absent." `layer_rollup` (`:388-393`): L1 scaffold, **L2 absent
  (entirely)**, L3 latency-penalty sizer (no broker; no order lifecycle), L4 agent_telemetry
  only, risk sublayer absent.
- `src/live/rat_ensemble.py:90` -- `RATModel.predict` raises `NotImplementedError`;
  `src/live/rat_ensemble.py:78` -- `VectorMemory.retrieve_similar` returns `[]`.
- `src/execution/async_engine.py:292` -- the L3 surface `print()`s executed-trade dataclasses; no
  broker, no order_id, no submission.
- `src/main.py:129`,`:139` -- live mode wires `mock_signal_generator` and
  `mock_market_data_source`.
- `docs/AUDIT-PROMPT-product-roadmap-yaml.md` Section 11 -- the embedded pivot transcript ("## 11.
  PIVOT TRANSCRIPT", begins ~`:3139`; Parts A/C/E/G document data architecture, the four-layer
  model, identifiability/execution/funnel, hedging/environments). "Concurrent paper trading
  alongside live" appears as a design element both in the summary body (~`:288`, Section 3.3) and
  within the transcript itself (~`:3670`). the retired product roadmap recorded Parts B/D/F as
  "user questions only". (Re-derive all these line pointers; the file is large and anchors rot.)

**The state of the bet (from the adjacent, in-frame audits -- context, not to be re-derived):**
- `audits/platform-roadmap-mvp-triage-7d57a0d.md` and `.yaml` -- MVP reachability
  `reachable_with_resequencing`; telemetry verdict `binding_but_underscoped`; **"zero telemetry
  is captured or stored today"**, write path dead since 2026-05-28, open `rec-2173` records the
  blind spot; the executor freeze constrains plan-type/executor-operation, not construction.
- `audits/executor-roadmap-review-7d57a0d.yaml` -- the T4 executor design review (in-frame).

**Controls that operate inside the frame:**
- `.claude/skills/plan-critique/SKILL.md:69-100` -- Phase 2b "Frame Challenge (MANDATORY)":
  challenges an individual plan's frame; recommends REVISE only on a concrete contradiction with
  a Decision, roadmap item, or North Star principle (`:85`).

**Governing constraints:** Decision 67 / CD.17 (executor freeze), Decision 84 (DuckLake backend),
Decision 101 (public repo), Decision 77 (environment taxonomy), Decision 93 (defer-by-exception).

## 11. EMPIRICAL PASS

Two bounded sampling operations. Observed findings outrank static ones at equal severity; tag
each finding `evidence_kind: static | observed`. **Boundary:** `observed` = the finding is
grounded in one of the sampling passes below (the citation census tabulation, or the pivot-timing
read) -- i.e. it rests on a body of sampled artifacts you examined. `static` = grounded in
reading a single named anchor without a sampling pass. When in doubt, tag `static`.

- **Citation census (cap: ALL hits, expect on the order of several dozen -- ~39 across docs/ +
  audits/ at compose time, 0 in the recs log; most are in-frame citations in the adjacent audits
  and audit-prompt files. Take ALL hits; do NOT synthesize beyond what you find).**
  `rg -n "platform-first|platform first|platform-before-product"` across `docs/` and `audits/`
  and `logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl`. For **each** hit apply the counterfactual test: *does
  this artifact RATIFY the sequencing (records it as a decision with alternatives), or merely
  ASSUME it (cites it as an operating given)?* Tabulate ratify-vs-assume counts; this is the
  primary evidence for Q1 / VD1.
- **Pivot-timing read (cap: Section 11 of `docs/AUDIT-PROMPT-product-roadmap-yaml.md`, plus the
  two grounding-map anchors already cited there -- ~`:288` and ~`:3670`; do NOT read further into
  that file).** Determine whether platform-vs-product *timing/sequencing* is discussed anywhere in
  that material (as opposed to product architecture). Record the answer explicitly -- it gates
  trap 5 and CAND-A.

## 12. METHOD

- **P1 Read.** All Section 10 anchors, re-verifying each. Run Section 5 setup.
- **P2 Trace.** Adjudicate each Section 9 candidate against the anchors and the North Star.
- **P3 Empirical.** Run the two Section 11 passes.
- **P4 Rate.** Fill `rubric_ratings[]` per surface; answer Q1-Q6.
- **P5 Dedup.** Section 13 discipline on every prospective finding.
- **P6 Synthesize LAST.** Fill the decision block, `per_surface_assessment`, `summary`, and
  compute maturity (Section 15) top-down. Never compute maturity before findings are final.

## 13. DEDUP DISCIPLINE

Before filing ANY finding, grep the ownership surfaces and record the search on the finding
(`roadmap_crossref.dedup_search_terms`, `dedup_hit_count`). A hit means you assess *sufficiency*
(planned-insufficient / planned-unbuilt) or reject (fully-covered) -- never file it as a fresh
discovery. A finding without a recorded negative search is a `HYPOTHESIS`, not `CONFIRMED`.

Ownership surfaces:
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` (`rg "^## Decision"` for headers; full-text for premise citations).
- `docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml` `tier_items[]`.
- `logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl` (open recs).
- `audits/` (adjacent audits already own MVP-reachability and telemetry-binding -- do not
  re-derive their content; cite them).

**Deliberate-constraints do-not-flag list (each with its id -- these are settled; do not raise
them as gaps):**
- Executor freeze -- Decision 67 / CD.17 (trigger-gated).
- DuckLake sole backend -- Decision 84.
- Public-repo boundary -- Decision 101.
- Environment taxonomy / sandbox auto-apply -- Decision 77.
- defer-by-exception + no-enumerated-MVP -- Decision 93.
- The product architecture / four-layer model / MVP-v1 -- pivot transcript (settled).
- Product roadmap dormancy (`status: draft`) -- by design under the frame; do not flag the draft
  status itself as a defect (the audit examines WHETHER the frame is right, not the dormancy's
  mechanics). Note the roadmap IS Pydantic-validated (`product_roadmap.py`); it is dormant, not
  unvalidated.

The audit examines the *allocation frame above* these. Reopening any of them is out of scope.

## 14. OUTPUT

Write both deliverables. The YAML is the system of record; the `.md` is a <= ~1500-word executive
report leading with the two headline verdicts -- **Q1 provenance** and **Q5 disposition** -- then
the Q2/Q3 costs and value, then the disposition's mechanism and rationale.

```

**COUNTING INVARIANT:** `findings[]` is the SOLE enumerated list. `total_findings =
len(findings) = novel_count + planned_insufficient_count + planned_unbuilt_count`. Fully-covered
or not-a-gap candidates live in `rejected_candidates[]`, NOT findings. `rubric_ratings`,
`question_answers`, and `sequencing_verdict` are systems-of-record referenced FROM findings,
never re-counted. `top_improvements` and `highest_leverage_change` MUST be finding ids -- EXCEPT
the zero-findings case: if `findings[]` is empty, set `top_improvements: []` and
`highest_leverage_change: null` (a valid, honest result -- the disposition still lives in
`sequencing_verdict.frame`). A finding that surfaces from a Q6-discovered gap with no matching
rubric cell may set `dimension: n/a`.

`control_property_match` is REQUIRED whenever a compensating control is the reason for dismissal:
name the property the control exercises, cite where it operates, and state why it would FAIL if
the gap were real. A control that could not catch the gap neither lowers severity nor dismisses a
candidate. `CONFIRMED` requires the behavior traced to file:line or a sampled artifact; anything
less is `HYPOTHESIS`.

## 15. SEVERITY + MATURITY

Assign severity AFTER judgment, by defect class -- never inherited from this prompt's framing or
ordering:
- **critical** = active work across the roadmap is being materially mis-directed *right now* by
  an unsound premise (the premise is both unexamined AND you judge it likely wrong on the
  evidence).
- **high** = a governance weakness that materially reduces confidence in the allocation (e.g., a
  consequential frame with no reversal trigger and no owned challenger) AND whose compensating
  controls you judged insufficient.
- **medium** = a recorded-but-thin treatment, ambiguity, or missing ratification with a clear
  fix. **low** = clarity / wording / documentation placement.

An unratified-but-sound frame is typically NOT critical -- the defect is the *absence of a
conscious record*, whose natural remedy is `ratify_with_reversal_conditions`, not a resequence.
Let the evidence, not the word "unratified", set severity.

**Maturity** -- compute LAST, per surface. A `shared`-surface finding counts toward BOTH
surfaces' critical/high tallies. Evaluate the ladder **in the order listed below, top-down; the
FIRST predicate that matches wins** (so a surface with 0 critical / 0 high is `frontier`, not
`strong`, because `frontier` is tested first). Pin these thresholds:
- `frontier` = 0 open critical AND 0 open high findings on that surface.
- `strong` = 0 critical AND <= 1 high.
- `solid` = <= 1 critical.
- `nascent` = otherwise.

The top rating remains reachable if you argued a property-matched compensating control -- the
framing must not foreclose it.

## 16. COMMIT / PR MECHANICS

1. Derive the base ONCE: `git fetch origin main` then `git rev-parse --short origin/main`. This
   sha IS the audited tree; use it in both deliverable filenames, the branch name, and
   `meta.audited_commit`.
2. `git switch -c audit/platform-first-sequencing-<sha> origin/main` so the PR diff is only the
   two deliverable files. This is a deliberate, documented exception to the `claude/*`
   session-branch rule: this audit session needs a clean two-file diff off the audited base. The
   CI signal-green comment wake fires only on `claude/*` PRs -- irrelevant here; you end your turn
   without merging, and the human disposes of the PR.
3. Repo-wide validation is advisory outside CI here: a clean YAML parse of the two deliverables is
   the real pre-push gate. An unrelated `validate --pre` failure is recorded in
   `meta.contract_notes`, never fixed (write boundary).
4. Commit with `git -c user.name=Claude -c user.email=noreply@anthropic.com commit --no-gpg-sign`
   (signing may be unavailable; that is expected). `git push -u origin HEAD`.
5. Open the PR via `mcp__github__create_pull_request` (derive `owner`/`repo` from
   `git remote get-url origin`; base=`main`, ready for review, title
   `audit: platform-first sequencing frame (sequencing-frame, product-loop-feasibility)`, body =
   the `summary` block in a YAML fence plus a 2-3 sentence lede). Then **END THE TURN** -- do not
   poll, do not merge, do not subscribe.

## 17. GUARDRAILS

- **Write boundary (closed list):** the ONLY files you create or modify in the tree are
  `audits/platform-first-sequencing-<sha>.yaml` and `audits/platform-first-sequencing-<sha>.md`.
  Regenerating gitignored local caches per Section 5 is expected and does not breach this; never
  commit them. Do not edit any audited surface, any Decision, any roadmap, any skill, or
  `validate.py`.
- **Precision over volume.** Fewer than ~4 surviving findings is a valid, honest result -- state
  it; do not pad. A finding you cannot trace to file:line or a sampled artifact is a `HYPOTHESIS`
  and must say so.
- **No verdict inheritance.** "Never ratified" is a fact, not a conviction. Ratifying the frame
  as-is or with reversal conditions is a full-credit outcome. `insufficient_evidence` is
  legitimate if the evidence does not discriminate.
- **Stay above the immunized constraints (Section 13 list).** The audit is about the allocation
  frame, not the substrate beneath it.
- You draft; the human disposes. End your turn after opening the PR.
