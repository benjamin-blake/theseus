# DuckLake maintenance ADMIN singleton Lambda (T2.18 / CD.33, Decision 81; T2.18 c9 follow-on
# split, bundled Decision amending Decision 81 clause 1, runtime artifacts 3 -> 4).
#
# Admin-gated: retains the production-destructive and operational verbs (catalog_reinit,
# restore_drill, reconcile_columns, catalog_stats, clone_catalog) plus the scheduled merge_ops
# cadence (production ops_* catalog, every 6h, non-destructive). The non-destructive smoke cadences
# (merge/gc/hot_merge/breaker_probe) moved to ducklake_maintenance_smoke.tf's CI-invokable sibling
# function -- see that file for the corresponding EventBridge rules (moved there via `moved {}`
# blocks preserving their AWS name/ARN).
#
# reserved_concurrent_executions = 1: maintenance is a singleton (Decision 81 clause 6).
# NOTE: the writer Lambda (ducklake_lambdas.tf) intentionally does NOT set reserved_concurrency so
# its OCC concurrency model is not artificially constrained (Decision 81 clause 3 + Decision 82).
# The maintenance pipeline IS intentionally a singleton -- it must not run concurrently with itself.
# The reserved_concurrency=1 here is correct and is NOT a keyword-collision with the writer's OCC
# model. This distinction is documented to pre-empt a reviewer flag.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# APPLY POSTURE (Decision 35 + 77): HUMAN-GATED via agent_platform_admin.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file creates a NEW IAM role + inline policy, which trips the Decision-77 deterministic guard
# (scripts/terraform_apply_guard.py, fail-closed on IAM/trust change). Apply routes to the MANUAL
# agent_platform_admin path, NOT push-to-main auto-apply. IAM must precede the code deploy:
#   1. build_lambda --ducklake-only       (upload all zips + layers to S3)
#   2. terraform plan -> human review -> terraform apply via agent_platform_admin
#   3. build_lambda --ducklake-only --deploy  (update the function code pointers from S3)
#
# CODE/INFRA COUPLING (Decision 125, environment-taxonomy.yaml conformance): RESOLVED. The
# aws_lambda_function resource below now carries a lifecycle block ignoring source_code_hash
# changes, so code-only redeploys no longer surface as a Terraform diff on this apply path. Code
# deploys now go via the governed CD channel (.github/workflows/deploy-ducklake-lambdas.yml, T2.38).
#
# FP-B (2026-06-07): shared SNS topic (sns_alerts.tf) created and wired as the alarm_actions
# target for BOTH this circuit-breaker alarm AND the CD.34 catalog-DR freshness alarm.

# (period=86400, evaluation_periods=7, datapoints_to_alarm=7 -- exactly 604800s, the >=3600
