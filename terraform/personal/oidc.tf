# GitHub Actions OIDC -> personal-account IAM roles (PLAN-public-migration Step 8, CD.21).
#
# Replaces the retired self-hosted EC2 runner (Decision 68 -> CD.21). CI on GitHub-hosted
# ubuntu-latest assumes these roles via OIDC -- no static credentials, no IAM users (Decision 36/37
# scoped to the work account; the personal account has no such SCP, confirmed by the Phase A OIDC
# feasibility probe under agent_platform_admin).
#
# Two roles, split by trust:
#   branch (write) -- refs/heads/main + refs/heads/agent/*  -> main-validate / ci-rca portal writes
#   pr (read-only)  -- refs/pull/*                          -> PR-context read queries
# The account ID in ARNs comes from var.account_id (gitignored tfvars); never a committed literal.

  # entries were unmintable post-rename and have been removed with live proof -- all five CI
  # roles verified assuming under the immutable subject before this contraction landed. Every sub
  # site below MUST iterate this list -- never re-introduce a scalar `github_repo` local. This
  # list MUST stay identical to terraform/bootstrap's; the two roots cannot reference each other,

  # "OWNER@OWNER-ID/REPO@REPO-ID", never a full "repo:" sub prefix (every sub site below already
  # renders "repo:${repo}:<suffix>"; a "repo:"-prefixed entry here would render "repo:repo:..."
  # and match nothing). GitHub mints this immutable numeric-id subject for any repository renamed
  # or transferred after 2026-07-15 -- benjamin-blake/theseus renamed at 2026-08-15T12:55:57Z and
  # now presents ONLY this shape. The numeric ids -- not the name -- are the durable identity: a
  # future rename changes only the NAME half, so Decision 172 point 2's pre-stage playbook adds
  # the future name's immutable entry to this list ADDITIVELY, BEFORE the rename lands, which is
  # what keeps a future rename from repeating this outage. Never narrow this list to zero entries,
  # and never remove an entry without live proof of the replacement first -- the exact discipline
  # this contraction itself followed.
