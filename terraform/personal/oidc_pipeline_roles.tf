# GitHub Actions OIDC pipeline roles (planner dual-sub speculative-plan/drift + governed
# Lambda deploy) -- split from oidc.tf (Decision 166 terraform-class grandfather drain,
# PLAN-terraform-decompose-oidc-rename).
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Planner role (dual-sub speculative-plan + drift, T2.49 c2 / DEP-12 / Decision 144): merges
# github_ci_plan (PR-sub, CD.35 Wave 2 / T2.21) + github_ci_drift (main-sub, CD.35 Wave 5 /
# T2.24) into ONE identity trusting BOTH subs, partitioned by sts:RoleSessionName so
# convergence-write stays fail-closed and non-spoofable (Decision 92 pt2).
#
# This role is IAM-SENSITIVE -- the deterministic guard (scripts/terraform_apply_guard.py)
# BLOCKS its creation (exit 2) and it lands via the human-gated tf-gated-apply Environment
# (Decision 77/92). The speculative-plan job's assume-role step carries continue-on-error to
# cover any residual bootstrap window; the drift workflow's assume-role step does the same.
#
# Trust partition (the fail-closed discriminator, Decision 92 pt2):
#   - MAIN-sub statement: sub=refs/heads/main AND sts:RoleSessionName StringEquals the
#     RESERVED session-name (local.convergence_writer_session_name) -- ONLY the scheduled
#     drift workflow (which sets this exact role-session-name) can satisfy this statement.
#   - PR-sub statement: sub in {pull_request, ref:refs/pull/*} AND sts:RoleSessionName
#     StringNotEquals the reserved name -- a PR-context assumption can NEVER present the
#     reserved session-name (the speculative-plan workflow sets a distinct, non-reserved
#     value), so it structurally cannot satisfy the main-sub statement either.
# A PR-context assumption therefore cannot obtain the reserved session-name under ANY
# statement -- the trust half of the fail-closed guarantee. The permission half (below) adds
# the aws:userid condition on ConvergenceRecordWrite so even a hypothetical main-sub session
# that omits the reserved name gains no convergence-write eligibility.
#
# Capability union (plan + drift, unconditioned except ConvergenceRecordWrite):
#   from github_ci_plan  -- TfplanWrite, DucklakeBuildInputsRead, DucklakeLambdaPackagesWrite.
#   from github_ci_drift -- TfstateNativeLockFile, DuckLakeWriterInvoke (writer-only, Decision
#                            84 closed boundary), ConvergenceRecordWrite (now FAIL-CLOSED,
#                            aws:userid-conditioned -- see validate_convergence_writer_isolation
#                            for the standing semantic check).
# Same refresh-read surface as before (ci_full_refresh_read, composed below) -- unchanged.
