# CD.28 T0.4 -- Tier 1 (DeepSeek) and Tier 2 (Anthropic) inference credential envelopes.
#
# Secret VALUES are set out-of-band via aws secretsmanager put-secret-value -- never Terraform-managed.
# No secret-version resources: key material must never enter Terraform state
# (docs/contracts/secret-material-handling.yaml SECRET-VALUE-OUT-OF-BAND pattern, Decision 175 --
# rehomed from the Decision 37 precedent). The neon_ducklake_catalog.tf DSN is the in-band
# counter-example; these API keys differ -- they are entered by the human via CLI and must never
# appear in state.
#
# Both ARNs are exported as outputs and referenced by the InferenceCredentialsRead IAM statement
# in platform_roles.tf, ensuring the grant is ARN-scoped (no wildcard).
#
# APPLY POSTURE (Decision 77 + terraform/CLAUDE.md):
# The aws_secretsmanager_secret creates are NOT in the guard's IAM_SENSITIVE_TYPES and would normally
# auto-apply. However, the InferenceCredentialsRead statement added to platform_roles.tf IS an IAM
# change and fail-closes the guard, so the ENTIRE plan (secrets + IAM) goes through the
# interactive human-gated plan -> present -> accept -> apply loop. IAM apply precedes any runtime
# use of the credentials (IAM-precedence rule).

# Tag values: ASCII-tag-charset only (letters/digits/spaces and + - = . _ : / @). The AWS Secrets
# Manager tagging service rejects parentheses, so the tier reference is written "T0.4", not "(T0.4)"
# (the latter fails TagResource with InvalidRequestException and blocks every module apply).
