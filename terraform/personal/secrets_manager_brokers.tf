# T2.14 -- Alpaca broker credential envelopes (paper + live).
#
# Secret VALUES are set out-of-band via aws secretsmanager put-secret-value -- never Terraform-managed.
# No secret-version resources: key material must never enter Terraform state
# (docs/contracts/secret-material-handling.yaml SECRET-VALUE-OUT-OF-BAND pattern, Decision 175 --
# rehomed from the Decision 37 precedent; mirrors inference_credentials.tf). The ARNs are exported
# as outputs and referenced by
# the BrokerCredentialsRead IAM statement in platform_roles.tf, ensuring the grant is ARN-scoped (no wildcard).
#
# APPLY POSTURE (Decision 77 + Decision 35):
# aws_secretsmanager_secret creates are NOT in the guard's IAM_SENSITIVE_TYPES and would normally
# auto-apply. However, the BrokerCredentialsRead statement added to platform_roles.tf IS an IAM
# change and fail-closes the guard (guard exit 2), so the ENTIRE plan (secrets + IAM) lands via
# agent_platform_admin (PlatformAdmin) interactive apply: terraform plan -> present -> accept -> apply.
# IAM apply precedes any runtime credential read (IAM-precedence rule).
#
# Tag values: ASCII-tag-charset only (letters/digits/spaces and + - = . _ : / @). The AWS Secrets
# Manager tagging service rejects parentheses, so tier references are written "T2.14", not "(T2.14)"
# (the latter fails TagResource with InvalidRequestException and blocks every module apply).
# Mirrors the inference_credentials.tf precedent verbatim.
