# Event source for the platform-security-* IAM-change detector (rec-4044, Decision 202).
#
# One multi-region trail homed in var.aws_region. IAM is a global service whose events are
# delivered only to trails that cover IAM's home region; a multi-region trail with global service
# events receives them and forwards every region's events to its one CloudWatch Logs group here, so
# no second-region provider or resource exists (Decision 202 clause 4).
#
# Lives in this admin-applied root so the detector sits outside the reach of the principals it
# watches: CI grants stop at agent-platform-*/ducklake-* names, and PlatformDev holds no
# logs/cloudwatch/cloudtrail/s3 write on these resources. The trail, bucket and log group carry
# prevent_destroy -- destroying the trail is break-glass only (Decision 202 clause 2).
