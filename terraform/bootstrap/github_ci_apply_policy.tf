  # forward apply is free to SHRINK the inline policy first; if the create-or-attach then fails, the
  # role holds ZERO refresh-read surface and every subsequent CD plan dies AccessDenied BEFORE the
  # guard runs, including any reconcile. With it, the worst case is the reads being granted twice
  # for one step -- an identical allow-union, harmless. The ROLLBACK direction is the mirror image
  # and is NOT expressible in HCL: restore the inline read Sids FIRST, then detach; never detach the
  # reads policy alone.
