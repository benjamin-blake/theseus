# rec-2793 / policy-architecture split (Decision NNN_PLACEHOLDER): the 11 READ-ONLY Sids below were

# inline identity policy was at 10,156 B of the 10,240 B AWS hard limit (84 B of headroom), and the
# write-surface remediation adds ~2,384 B -- so the relocation is a PREREQUISITE for the fix, not an
# optimisation. A LimitExceeded on an inline policy is INVISIBLE to `terraform plan`; it surfaces only
# at apply. Governing principle: READS MOVE, AUTHORITY STAYS -- every iam: write Sid and BOTH Deny

        # widening anything value-capable by one byte.
        #
        # INVARIANT -- RE-CHECK THIS BEFORE ADDING ANY VERB HERE: every secretsmanager action

        # material. If AWS ever ships a value-returning verb under one of those prefixes, this Sid
