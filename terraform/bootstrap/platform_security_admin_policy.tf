# PlatformAdmin's detector-management grant for the platform-security-* IAM-change detector
# (rec-4044, Decision 202). A customer-managed policy, not an AdminOps inline statement:
# PlatformAdmin's inline aggregate has ~2.2 KB of its 10,240 B per-role headroom left (Decision 156
# managed-policy remedy). The role is referenced by its literal name because this root does not
# declare PlatformAdmin (PLAN-platform-iam-bootstrap-adopt moves it here later).
#
# Decision 202 clause 2: PlatformAdmin -- and only PlatformAdmin -- holds exactly six
# trail-management verbs on the ONE platform-security trail. cloudtrail:StopLogging,
# cloudtrail:DeleteTrail and cloudtrail:* are banned everywhere (TestCloudTrailWriteGrantScoped).
# No s3:DeleteBucket / s3:DeleteBucketPolicy / logs:DeleteLogGroup: destroying the detector is
# break-glass only. CloudWatch alarm verbs are not re-granted (AdminOps' CloudWatchAlarmManagement
# already covers alarm:*).
#
# The four PlatformSecurityHeartbeat* Sids below are the canary's (platform_security_heartbeat_canary.tf)
# management grant: enumerated states/scheduler verbs, no Delete* verb, no service wildcard,
# platform-security-* resources only. Removing the canary is break-glass only, matching the
# trail/bucket/log-group convention above.
