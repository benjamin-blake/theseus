# Bootstrap root: CI/CD apply role own IAM + authority budget (CD.35 Wave 4 / T2.23).
#
# WHY isolated: terraform/personal auto-applies from GitHub Actions via github_ci_apply. If that
# role's own IAM lived in personal, the pipeline could grant itself new privileges through the
# pipeline it gates (self-grant cycle). Moving the apply role + its permissions boundary to this
# admin-applied root breaks the cycle: github_ci_apply can no longer write its own policy.
#
# NEVER auto-apply: this root must only be applied manually under agent_platform_admin (PlatformAdmin,
# iam:*). Never add terraform/bootstrap/** to any apply-workflow path.
# See terraform/bootstrap/CLAUDE.md for the provisioning and ongoing apply runbook.
