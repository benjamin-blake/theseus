"""Shared test doubles for the tests/ducklake_neon_smoke_test/ concern-split suite (rec-2709 Wave 7).

Cross-concern shared helpers hoisted out of the former tests/test_ducklake_neon_smoke_test.py
monolith: the smoke FakeCon (records executed SQL; used by core + direct_gates), _Resp (the HTTP
response double; used by core's url-invoke primitives, every lambda-gate concern, and canary), and
_DSN (used by core + direct_gates). These are DISTINCT from tests/fixtures/ducklake_fakes.py's
runtime FakeCon/_DSN (different signatures/shapes) -- kept as a separate fixture module so bodies
stay verbatim. An importable tests/fixtures/ module -- exempt from the no-cross-test-import guard
because its name does not start with test_ (tests/CLAUDE.md).
