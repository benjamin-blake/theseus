"""ESB-10 / ESB-11 / ESB-04 / ESB-06 guards (PLAN-esb-text-fix-bundle).

Both DECISIONS.md trailers use the PINNED `> **Update (YYYY-MM-DD):**` form read from
docs/contracts/decision-entry.yaml amendment_forms (with `[Amendment ...]` explicitly rejected,
since neither trailer amends anything) and sit after the entry body; neither uses a supersession
verb; Decision 39's and Decision 75's original bodies are unchanged versus origin/main (append-only
-- no line removed or rewritten). CD.27's title no longer names the layer-2 substrate; CD.27's
cross-references name T4.12 and no longer offer the retired runner-cron option; the runtime list
includes .NET/C#. Both ratification-obligation discipline_points are present with the Decision 39
managed-primitive clause and the ESB-06 lapse clause. CD.27 remains state pending with
filed_via pending_log_decision_lambda.
