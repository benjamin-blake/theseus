"""ESB-02 fallback-spec carrier guards (PLAN-esb-fallback-spec-carrier, wave 3).

Covers three deliverables this wave lands directly in docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml's CD.27 block --
the `fallback_spec` discipline_point's well-formedness, the maturity-monitoring point's
phantom-free/carrier-bound invariants, and the precondition-discharge-rule point -- plus a
growth-safe anchor-phrase membership floor over the four CD.27 string discipline_points that the
retired CD.27-discipline-points byte-identity-vs-origin/main guard (formerly in
tests/esb_text_fix/test_workspace_store_criteria.py) covered only incidentally as a side effect
of asserting byte-identity against origin/main: S3 pointer pattern, "retry policies
are deterministic-only", the T4.x atomic-plan template point, and the EXR-07 amendment. That
guard's own load-bearing coverage (the three Layer-2 precondition strings staying byte-identical,
and the maturity point's stale "recorded as an INTENT Open Question" clause /
"checkpoint-replay verified" pointer being caught if reintroduced) is either already duplicated
by other live guards (cd27-layer2-preconditions-cover-esb01,
t4x-persona-contracts-mechanism-word-free) or asserted here, strictly stronger (exists exactly
once under a startswith anchor; does NOT contain "recorded as an INTENT Open Question"; does NOT
contain "checkpoint-replay verified"; DOES name fallback_spec and validate_fallback_reevaluation).
