"""ESB-03 persona-routing-rationale guards (PLAN-esb-routing-rationale, wave 4).

Guards the Decision 164 governance record that closes audit finding ESB-03: why T4.2's executor
personas route to the Decision 122 LiteLLM tiers even though they satisfy Decision 116's agentic
criterion, and the consequence a reopen would carry (the viable persona substrate set collapses to
the CLI-hosting class, taking the CD.27 incumbent `durable_functions` and its ESB-02 fallback
`self_checkpointed_lambda_dynamodb` with it).

Three hazards this wave measured that the eight-field registry rows structurally cannot carry:

MATCHER ASYMMETRY -- two different matchers read Decision 164's title and disagree, which is why
the Decision 122 forward pointer is guard-enforced while the Decision 116 one is voluntary.
`_EDGE_RE` in scripts/checks/decisions/validate_supersession_annotations.py requires the relation
word IMMEDIATELY adjacent to its target, so on the title's `(amends Decision 122 and Decision 116)`
parenthetical it extracts ONLY 122 -- making the (164, 122) edge real and FAILing that guard unless
Decision 122's block carries a "Decision 164" backpointer. `extract_amends_edges` in
scripts/decisions_md.py uses the whitelist-continuation grammar ("and-continuation") and extracts
BOTH, which is why the index projection reads `amends: [116, 122]`. No (164, 116) supersession edge
is extracted, so the Decision 116 trailer is a class-versus-site sweep rather than a mechanical
obligation. This module deliberately does NOT assert the absence of a (164, 116) edge: that would
pin a current limitation of someone else's regex, and widening `_EDGE_RE` to handle the
and-continuation (owned by rec-2971) is a legitimate improvement that must not redden these guards.

TITLE-STRIP TRUNCATION -- the parser stores `title` as `re.sub(r"\\s*\\(.*?\\)\\s*$", "", raw_title)`
(scripts/decisions_md.py), whose lazy quantifier plus end-anchor drops EVERYTHING from the FIRST
opening parenthesis onward. Every load-bearing phrase must therefore sit BEFORE the `(amends ...)`
parenthetical or it is invisible to the decision-scout index.

RETIREMENT OWNER -- the index-projection test below reads docs/decisions-index.json, which Decision
160 point 13 designates an INTERIM triage surface. T1.5 c1 owns replacing decision-scout's Phase 1
step 1 with a queried portal/tool call; when that lands, this file stops being the triage surface
and the graduated row `dec-164-index-triage-discoverable` (plus the test below) RETIRES WITH T1.5 c1
rather than becoming a standing maintenance obligation.

The grep-row CLASS test at the bottom is not graduable (it passes on origin/main, so it cannot meet
VF-05 / Decision 132 differential admission) and ships as a standing unit test instead -- which is
also the only carrier that keeps guarding the class after this PR merges, since merged registry rows
are never re-executed.
