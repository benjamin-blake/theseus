"""Tests for the MANDATORY-DECLARATION lifecycle-companion table (design (b)).

Mirror of scripts/checks/iam_tf/_write_companions.py. The load-bearing case is
TestDeleteRolePreFixRegression: it builds the PRE-FIX policy (iam:DeleteRole granted at
role/agent-platform-*, iam:ListInstanceProfilesForRole absent) and asserts the delete row FAILS --
i.e. proves the phase-keyed table would have caught rec-2882 at REVIEW time instead of in a live
gated destroy. The rest of the module covers the mandatory-declaration negatives (a WRITE_COVERAGE
type with no declaration; an empty companion tuple with no justification), the inert-row skip, the
boundary-ceiling assertion, and the facade wiring that keeps the checker out of dead-code status.

Self-contained by construction (no cross-test imports): the synthetic bootstrap HCL below is this
module's own, and scripts.checks._common.ROOT is monkeypatched to a tmp_path tree for every case
that exercises the boundary re-read.
