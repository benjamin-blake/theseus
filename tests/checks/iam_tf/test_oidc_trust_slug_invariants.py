"""Standing guards for the OIDC trust invariants, originated by PLAN-repo-rename-relicense and
carried forward by PLAN-oidc-trust-contraction-closure's contraction to the immutable entry alone.

THREE durable invariants -- the first two survive any future contraction or rename; the third is
the contraction's own durable successor, replacing what used to be a time-boxed dual-slug window:

  1. Decision 94 both-sub-forms: the bootstrap apply role's trust carries BOTH the
     ref:refs/heads/main form (routine auto-apply) and the environment:tf-gated-apply form
     (the gated-apply job, where GitHub OVERRIDES sub to the environment claim). Dropping the
     environment form silently ungates every gated apply -- the VP9 regression Decision 94 was
     written to prevent, and the exact failure class a rename window makes easy to hit.

  2. Cross-root slug-list agreement: terraform/personal and terraform/bootstrap each declare
     their own local.github_repos (no cross-root resource reference is possible). The two lists
     must stay identical, or a contraction can narrow one root and miss the other -- a divergence
     otherwise caught only post-deploy, after the apply has landed.

  3. Immutable-format-only (Decision 172, TestImmutableSubjectEntry.test_every_entry_is_immutable_format):
     every declared entry must match OWNER@OWNER-ID/REPO@REPO-ID. A legacy name-only entry mints
     nothing post-rename and must never survive a contraction.

Assertions 1 and 2 pin no COUNT of trusted slugs. Assertion 3 is a FORMAT assertion for the same
reason: Decision 172 point 2's pre-stage playbook adds a future name's immutable entry additively,
BEFORE any later rename, so a transient multi-entry state must stay green throughout -- a count
assertion would wrongly reject that additive staging the moment it happened (tests/CLAUDE.md
"Test-count coupling").
