"""validate_decision_entry_conformance's --pre tier registration (PLAN-decision-entry-flow-
governance, CFG-03's "fails --pre" acceptance).

Before this plan, validate_decision_entry_conformance was full-tier only (registry.py), so it
fired post-merge on main and never gated the PR -- this module's own assertion is genuinely red
against the pre-change tree, because the pre-existing
test_pre_sequence_meets_required_floor asserts a SUBSET floor (REQUIRED_PRE_CHECKS <= actual),
which adding a check never reddens.
