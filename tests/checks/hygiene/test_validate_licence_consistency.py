"""Tests for validate_licence_consistency() (Decision 171).

Two invariants, exercised in both directions. The negative cases are driven by FIXTURE trees
under tmp_path, never by mutating the real repository, so a test that proves the check goes red
on an old-slug survivor keeps proving it after the rename is complete. One test runs the check
against the real tree to assert the shipped artefacts actually satisfy it.
