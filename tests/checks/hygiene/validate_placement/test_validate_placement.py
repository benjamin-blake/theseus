"""Tests for validate_placement() core router/dead-target logic (RS-04 link-validity gate,
docs/contracts/file-router.yaml). Concern-split module 1 of 2 (OPEN RISK 1, rec-2709 Wave 1):
the former 522-SLOC TestValidatePlacement class is split across this module (generic router
behavior) and test_root_allowlists.py (docs-root / scripts-root allowlist enforcement), both
under scripts/checks/hygiene/validate_placement.py's declared _CONCERN_SPLIT_TEST_PACKAGES
package. Retains the original TestValidatePlacement class name (this half's methods keep
their exact pre-move class::function id); the other half is TestValidatePlacementRootAllowlists
(the one permitted class-qualifier id delta for this wave, per the plan's OPEN RISK 1
resolution).
