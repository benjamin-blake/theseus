"""Tests for scripts/checks/_marker_guard.py -- the shared raise-marker authorization module
(Decision 165, audit finding SGE-07, PLAN-size-gov-marker-guard).

Carries the BULK of the new coverage this plan introduces: extractor shapes (class-table
exclusion, comment immunity), the authorization rule (bare-root negative, band positive, no
body tokenization), composite `dir::step-id` keys, the supersession hop, moved-from, the empty
grandfather hook, and the cross-registry live-marker invariant + an independent-scan population
cross-check. Thin binding assertions for each of the five consumer guards live alongside their
own tests instead (mirror convention, Decision 131)."""
