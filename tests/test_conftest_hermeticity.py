"""Tests proving the global hermetic-AWS guard fixtures in tests/conftest.py (rec-2484).

L1 (_hermetic_aws_profile) and L2 (_block_unmocked_aws_client) are two independent,
defense-in-depth layers:

- L1 makes boto3.Session(profile_name=...) raise ProfileNotFound deterministically -- no real
  named profile or ambient credential env var can satisfy it, on dev or CI alike.
- L2 raises loudly on any un-mocked AWS client construction (boto3.client/resource/
  Session().client) that reaches past L1 -- e.g. the boto3 default credential chain, which
  does not require a named profile at all.

Each layer has its own opt-out marker: @pytest.mark.integration bypasses L1 only;
@pytest.mark.aws bypasses L2 only. A genuinely live-AWS integration test needs BOTH markers
to fully bypass both layers -- this is deliberate (rec-2484 acceptance criteria), not an
oversight.
