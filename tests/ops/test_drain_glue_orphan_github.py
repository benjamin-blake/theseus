"""Reachability regression guard for scripts/ops/drain_glue_orphan/_github.py (rec-3381).

Both defects previously found in this module were invisible because its tests asserted argv
shapes against invented payloads while mocking subprocess.run; there is no rehearsal subject left
after the drain. These tests drive the four COMMITTED, REAL mcp__github__ payloads
(tests/fixtures/drain_glue_orphan_payloads/) through the normalizer and pure oracles, with paired
NEGATIVES proving the four gh-shaped assumptions the predecessor module made are provably dead:

  1. `id` is read; `databaseId` (the gh CLI's own --json field name) is not.
  2. `created_at` is read; a payload carrying only `createdAt` correlates ZERO candidates -- the
     silent-forever failure this drain exists to close, not a raised exception.
  3. list_workflow_jobs' real envelope double-nests as {"jobs": {"jobs": [...]}}; a single-nested
     {"jobs": [...]} dict (the gh CLI's own shape) does not resolve the job list.
  4. get_job_logs' real envelope is flat ({job_id, logs_content, message, original_length}) with
     no logs[] array and no job_name key; a truncated log (fewer returned lines than
     original_length) raises rather than silently licensing a destruction/no-destroy verdict.
