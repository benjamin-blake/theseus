"""Pure, connection-free maintenance scope resolution (compaction-scope-policy-matrix, T2.18).

Replaces the retired suffix-matching naming-convention predicate action_merge_ops used to
discover which tables the production compaction cadence touches with catalog enumeration crossed
against a declared per-class, per-verb policy matrix (config/lambda/ducklake/
field_semantics.static.yaml -> maintenance_policy).

Every table is classified via the SAME registry the runtime already carries -- field_semantics'
ops_tables entries, keyed by each table's own declared `write_mode` and `history_table`/
`current_table` names -- never a string pattern matched against a physical table name. No I/O:
every function here operates on already-fetched catalog rows / already-loaded registry data, so
each predicate is directly unit-testable (the split Decision 188 used for
src/common/ducklake_maintenance_ops.py).
