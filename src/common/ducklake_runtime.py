"""DuckLake operational-lakehouse runtime facade (T2.17 / CD.33, Decision 81).

Single ATTACH/connection authority: this module owns the warm-connection cache and the one
ATTACH implementation shared by the ducklake_writer/ducklake_reader Lambdas and the Neon smoke
test (dev/smoke installs extensions over the network; the Lambda path loads them from a baked
layer; `extension_directory` selects the mode).

Design invariants (CD.33):
  - Idempotent append: the history table is keyed by a monotonic ULID minted ONCE per write,
    OUTSIDE the OCC-retry loop, and reused on every retry. MERGE-on-ULID insert-if-not-matched
    de-duplicates, so a retried write never double-appends (no engine PK; the ULID is a logical
    key enforced by MERGE).
  - Schema gate + OCC exhaustion LOUD-FAIL (Decision 55): a rejected field or an exhausted
    retry budget raises; there is never a silent drop or an Athena fallback.
  - Version lockstep (OQ.12): DuckDB is pinned to PINNED_DUCKDB_VERSION; a runtime assert fails
    loudly on mismatch.

Split invariant (PLAN-sloc-ducklake-layer): the write/table-DDL/read/metrics primitives now live
in ducklake_writes / ducklake_tables / ducklake_reads / ducklake_metrics; this module re-exports
every symbol so `from src.common.ducklake_runtime import X`, `rt.X`, and
`patch("src.common.ducklake_runtime.X")` call sites keep binding to real module attributes at the
original path. The pure schema layer (spec/SQL builders/gate) lives in ducklake_scd2_schema, whose
re-export block below is unchanged. Dependency is strictly one-directional: this facade imports
the sub-modules; none of them import it back (Decision 80 acyclic-import discipline).
