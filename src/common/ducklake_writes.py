"""DuckLake writer-owned SCD2 write path (T2.17 / CD.33, Decision 81; split from ducklake_runtime).

Owner concern: the write primitives (write_scd2, file_scd2) plus everything they call
intra-module -- OCC retry/backoff, rollback, metric emission, and the writer-owned
entity-id allocation cluster (Decision 84 I-2). Entity-allocation is co-located here
(rather than with the table-DDL concern in ducklake_tables) so write_scd2 ->
_advance_entity_counter and file_scd2 -> _allocate_entity_id stay intra-module calls --
no writes<->tables import cycle.

Dependency is strictly one-directional: this module imports shared schema symbols FROM
ducklake_scd2_schema (+ stdlib) only, and NEVER from the ducklake_runtime facade (Decision 80
acyclic-import discipline). Net DAG: ducklake_scd2_schema <- ducklake_writes <- ducklake_runtime.

    """Write one SCD2 record: history MERGE-on-ULID append + current write-through, one transaction.

    `table=None` writes the smoke pair (T2.17); a name selects an ops_tables entry (T2.19). The
    merge key, column order, and MERGE SQL are resolved from the spec, so this single primitive
    drives every governance table.

    Idempotency (CD.33 D-2): the ULID + timestamp are minted ONCE here, OUTSIDE the retry loop, and
    reused on every attempt. MERGE-on-ULID de-duplicates the history append, so a retried write
    never double-appends. `created_timestamp` is carried unchanged from the existing current row on
    update, and minted (= identity.timestamp) on first insert -- never re-stamped.

    Referential gate (CD.33 cl.8 / D-5): with `require_exists=True` (the update path), the
    in-transaction existing-row lookup must be non-empty -- an absent merge key raises ReferentialError
    BEFORE any MERGE, replacing the prior permissive upsert-on-absent.

    Status-DAG gate (Decision 103 / T1.16 c3): when *table* declares a DAG (STATUS_TRANSITIONS) and
    `require_exists=True`, the SAME existing-row fetch above also reads the current `status` (no
    second Neon round-trip) and calls check_rec_status_transition before the MERGE -- a resolved rec
    (closed/declined/superseded) silently reactivated to `open` raises StatusTransitionError. This
    check is OUTSIDE the OCC-collision retry path (Decision 82 / Decision 88): it is terminal, never
    retried, mirroring ReferentialError handling.

    `created_override` (operational backfill/re-seed path ONLY): when set AND the row is a fresh
    insert, it supplies the historical `created_timestamp` instead of `identity.timestamp`, so a
    migration/re-seed preserves each rec's ORIGINAL created time (Decision-64 anchor) while
    `identity.timestamp` carries the original last_updated. It has NO effect on the agent write path
    (always None there). The maintenance `seed_ops_recommendations` action that used this was removed
    at the 2026-06-09 recs sign-off; the parameter is retained for any future break-glass re-seed.

    Concurrency (CD.33): a serialization collision is retried with bounded backoff+jitter up to
    `max_attempts`; exhaustion raises OCCRetryExhaustedError (loud-fail, Decision 55). A non-OCC
    error propagates immediately -- never swallowed.

    Emits OccRetryCount + CommitLatencyMs via `metric_sink` (EC9) when provided.
