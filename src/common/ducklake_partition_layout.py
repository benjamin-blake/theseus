"""DuckLake live partition-layout READ half (Decision 204, PLAN-ducklake-partition-layout-remediation).

READ HALF ONLY (plan-critique r1): the reader boundary holds the same owner-privileged Neon
credential as the writer, so mutating code must never ship in the reader bundle -- see
ducklake_partition_rewrite.py for the MUTATE half, which imports this module but is never imported
back (Decision 80 acyclic-import discipline; the reader bundle carries this module and never that
one).

Reads DuckLake's own catalog metadata (__ducklake_metadata_<alias>) for the LIVE partition layout
of every table the field_semantics registry can classify: ducklake_table (end_snapshot IS NULL for
the live physical row), ducklake_partition_info (end_snapshot IS NULL for the ACTIVE scheme
generation), ducklake_partition_column + ducklake_column (the active scheme's ordered
(transform, column_name) pairs), and ducklake_data_file (end_snapshot IS NULL for live files;
partition_id names which scheme generation wrote each file, per #1278 -- NEVER a per-value bucket).
A live file whose partition_id IS DISTINCT FROM the active scheme id (including NULL, pre-partition)
is a legacy-scheme file: it was laid out under a superseded ALTER ... SET PARTITIONED BY generation
and needs rewrite_legacy_layout (ducklake_partition_rewrite.py) to physically re-lay it.

Imports scd2_schema / control_tables / maintenance_scope / partition_spec only (Decision 80).
