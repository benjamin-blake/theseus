"""Post-pass GC verification predicates for the production destructive-GC pass (T2.18,
docs/plans/PLAN-production-gc-and-storage-stability.yaml).

Pure-predicate / connection-owning split, exactly as Decision 188 split
src/common/ducklake_maintenance_ops.py: `referenced_missing` and `gc_debt_ratio` are pure
computations over already-fetched path/byte sets (no connection, no I/O), directly unit-testable;
`verify_read_path` is the connection-owning independent safety check.

SAFETY: `referenced_missing(live_paths, storage_paths)` is the |L \\ S| direction -- catalog-live
paths absent from storage. This is the over-reclaim signal a storage-size metric structurally
cannot see: deleting live data makes storage look smaller, i.e. BETTER by a naive metric. Non-empty
is a breach, never silently tolerated (Decision 55).

EFFICACY: `gc_debt_ratio(storage_bytes, live_bytes)` is (S - L) / L -- the quantity GC actually
controls. Absolute storage bytes are never the assertion: live bytes legitimately grow with
ingestion, so tracking absolute storage would trend upward even under a perfectly functioning GC.

INDEPENDENT SAFETY CHECK: `verify_read_path(con, snapshot_id, tables)` re-reads every table AT the
pass-start CATALOG snapshot id and aggregates over actual column VALUES. Snapshot identity is
CATALOG-level (expire_snapshots and this check both read ducklake_snapshots('{catalog}')), so ONE
id captured before the destructive pass covers every table -- never one id per table. A bare
count(*) at a pinned snapshot is answerable from DuckLake catalog record-count metadata with every
underlying Parquet file already deleted, and column min/max statistics have the same problem
(READ-PATH VACUITY) -- this check forces a real S3 read of every column so a bug that corrupts the
live-file function identically in the delete-set computation AND in `referenced_missing` (the
recorded Iceberg remove_orphan_files failure class: s3:// vs s3a://, double slashes, URL-encoded
paths) still gets caught.
