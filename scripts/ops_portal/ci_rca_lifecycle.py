Owner-concern: fingerprint-chain resolution, the regression-vs-drop ancestry classification, the
fix-linked / timestamp-based-inactivity / flake auto-close split, and the escape-attribution
helper. Decomposed out of ci_rca_runtime.py (Decision 128 SLOC budget) -- this module replaces the
rec-2644 close-then-recur revive path (its status-flip mutator and READ-ONLY recency finder, both
now REMOVED from ci_rca_runtime.py) with a chain model where a CLOSED head is NEVER mutated: a
recurrence against a closed head is either dropped (proven stale-code rerun via git ancestry) or
filed as a brand-new REGRESSION record, never a closed->open status flip (Decision 55, citing
Decision 103's closure-proof clause -- a closed rec carries a fixed_by_sha proof; reopening it
would discard that proof without evidence it no longer holds).
