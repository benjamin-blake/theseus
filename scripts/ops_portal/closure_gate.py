"""Closure-time artifact obligation for escape-classified recs (Decision 186).

Owner-concern: the escape-classified predicate, the `<kind>:<ref>` artifact grammar and its
FIX-BOUND resolver for the four kinds, the categorised waiver vocabulary, and the single
ClosureArtifactRequired(ValueError). Decomposed into its own module (Decision 128: ops_data_portal.py
had 78 SLOC of headroom, not enough for this body) and called from
scripts.ops_data_portal::update_rec immediately before _ducklake_write -- the single enforcement
site every path closing a writer-allocated rec-NNN funnels through.

RESOLUTION IS FIX-BOUND, NOT EXISTENCE-ONLY (Decision 186 point 4): a `<kind>:<ref>` token
resolves only when (i) its kind-specific fact holds AND (ii) its defining file was added or
modified in the closing write's `fixed_by_sha`. `check:<name>` resolves against the named
registry entry's TIER fact (scripts.checks._schema.Entry.pre is True), NEVER bare membership in
scripts.checks.registry._ALL_ENTRIES -- membership alone is vacuous for the majority escape mode
(tier_misplaced), whose catching check is already registered before any fix lands.

Never remediates (Decision 55/72): every function here either resolves a fact or raises. Nothing
in this module writes, files, retries, or downgrades a status. The single subprocess call is a
read-only local `git diff-tree` -- no network, no reader egress (Decision 88).
