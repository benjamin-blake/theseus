    Two rules, gated by a retiring grandfather-table (Decision 131, amends Decision 104):

    1. COLOCATION (grandfathered, retiring): while a source path's grandfathered test home's
       basename is still in _RETIRING_GRANDFATHER_HOMES, the pre-inversion colocation rule
       applies unchanged -- see _grandfathered_source_to_test for its full per-pattern table.
    2. MIRROR (post-retirement): once a wave deletes that basename from
       _RETIRING_GRANDFATHER_HOMES, every source path that grandfathers to it instead resolves
       via _mirror_source_to_test -- drop the leading src/scripts root, keep the remaining
       sub-path, name the file test_<stem>.py (or, for a declared concern-split monolith, the
       test PACKAGE DIRECTORY <mirror-subpath>/<stem>/). Examples: scripts/checks/hygiene/
       validate_prose_allowlist.py -> tests/checks/hygiene/test_validate_prose_allowlist.py;
       scripts/executor/step_runner.py -> tests/executor/test_step_runner.py;
       src/common/config.py -> tests/common/test_config.py; scripts/ops_writer.py (concern-split)
       -> tests/ops_writer/.

    WHY drop-root is safe/chosen: it matches established repo precedent (tests/checks/,
    tests/test_verifiers/) and standard pytest tree-mirroring, and is collision-free for the
    fixed 24-home roster because no scripts/<x>/ vs src/<x>/ subdirectory-name overlap exists.
    KNOWN BOUNDARY: a future scripts/<x>/ vs src/<x>/ collision would need a preserve-root
    exception for that pair -- out of scope now, flagged for the map's maintainer.

    scripts/executor/** and scripts/ops_portal/** deliberately return None on both rules
    (Decision 124) -- their grandfathered home is already None, so neither the retiring nor the
    mirror branch ever fires for them; a source path with no grandfathered home never joins the
    roster.

    Day one, _RETIRING_GRANDFATHER_HOMES == _ALL_MIRROR_TARGET_HOMES (every target was still
    retiring), so the mirror branch below was never taken and every result was byte-identical to
    the pre-inversion function (the TestMapSourceToTest / TestCheckTestFileExists oracle proved
    this on day one; see TestGrandfatherRetiringTable for the current, post-Wave-1 state). Each
    wave retires exactly one basename (a one-line, low-merge-conflict edit to
    _RETIRING_GRANDFATHER_HOMES) -- rec-2709 Wave 1 (PLAN-sloc-test-validate) retired
    "test_validate.py", the first of the 24-home roster to flip: every scripts/checks/**/*.py
    (and scripts/validate.py itself) now resolves via the mirror rule instead of colocating in
    the now-deleted tests/test_validate.py.

    scripts/checks/_scaffolding.py, _terraform.py, and _pytest_diff.py are a special case within
    the retired "test_validate.py" home: they are orchestration-internal helpers, not registered
    checks, so once "test_validate.py" retires they route to the SAME tests/validate/
    concern-split package scripts/validate.py resolves to (not the generic per-file mirror
    target) -- see _ORCHESTRATION_SCAFFOLDING_FILES.

    3. DIRECT CONCERN-SPLIT (independent of retirement): a source path listed in
       _CONCERN_SPLIT_TEST_PACKAGES resolves to its test PACKAGE DIRECTORY even if its
       grandfathered home's basename is still in _RETIRING_GRANDFATHER_HOMES (i.e. has not
       retired) or has no grandfathered home under _ALL_MIRROR_TARGET_HOMES at all. This
       decouples "is this source a declared concern-split monolith?" from "has this source's
       grandfathered home retired?" -- previously the only entry point into
       _CONCERN_SPLIT_TEST_PACKAGES was inside _mirror_source_to_test, reachable solely via
       the MIRROR branch above, so registering a file whose grandfathered home was not itself
       in _ALL_MIRROR_TARGET_HOMES was inert (the membership check was never consulted).

    the path is itself a declared concern-split entry, which is checked independently of
    having a grandfathered home).
