"""Utilities for parsing DECISIONS.md and reading local JSONL log files.

Extracted from backfill_ops_tables.py (deleted in dq-ops-rec-enforcement).

DAF-01 parity pass (PLAN-daf-etl-parity-fidelity): raw_block + content_hash carry the full
heading-inclusive section text as a parity backstop; reversal_conditions and superseded_by
are typed extractions; the Decision-marker regex tolerates decorated markers (e.g.
"**Decision (four invariants):**"); the related-decisions extractor accepts plural
"Decisions 69/78" cites and dedupes; the decided_date Status-suffix fallback is restricted
to ISO-shaped values.

DAF-03 shared-parser consolidation (PLAN-daf-authoring-grammar, Decision 134 cl.3): adds
iter_decision_headings() and decision_header_numbers() as the single public header-parsing
surface every structural consumer imports (the R1 ratification guard, the preflight
open-decisions counter, the forward conformance check) -- both built on the pre-existing
_DECISION_HEADING_RE grammar, never a rework of parse_decisions_md or the byte-reconstruction
invariant. See docs/contracts/decision-entry.yaml for the authoring grammar these enforce.

DCG-06 intent capture (PLAN-dcg-intent-capture, Decision 151): adds an `intent` key, a NEW
separate typed extraction via _extract_multiline_section(body, "Intent") -- the existing
`context` extraction (Rationale/Key details/Context) is untouched. Optional forever: no
required-marker change, no retro-enforcement of the historical band.

DCG-08 decisions index (PLAN-dcg-decisions-index): adds the public extract_amends_edges()
(forward "amends Decision N" title-relation extraction) plus the private
_extract_title_borne_supersedes() sibling, both built on the shared
_extract_title_relation_targets() whitelist-continuation grammar -- never a relation-keyword
blocklist, so a non-Decision target (CD.N, KG.N, prose like "Identity Center") is excluded
structurally rather than enumerated. Surfaces two INDEX-ONLY parse_decisions_md row keys,
"amends" and "title_supersedes", consumed solely by scripts/decisions_index.py -- neither key
is added to _DECISION_BACKFILL_COLS, DecisionPayload, or config/agent/data_quality (Decision
84 warehouse-safety boundary, mirrors the intent key's index-vs-warehouse separation).

Decision-entry flow governance (PLAN-decision-entry-flow-governance, Decision 167): adds
extract_entry_envelope(), a public reader for the optional typed metadata envelope -- a fenced
```yaml block immediately after a '## Decision N:' heading (docs/contracts/decision-entry.yaml
metadata_envelope). parse_decisions_md() prefers envelope values for status / decided_date /
amends / title_supersedes over the legacy bold-marker/title grammar, which remains the fallback
for every entry with no envelope (forward-only; the historical band is untouched, since none of
it carries one). Surfaces a new `significance` row key (the envelope's routing claim dict, or {}
when absent) -- INDEX-ONLY like amends/title_supersedes: never added to _DECISION_BACKFILL_COLS,
DecisionPayload, or the warehouse projection (Decision 166 point 9).

Decision-corpus currency (PLAN-decision-corpus-currency, rec-3055/rec-3056): promotes
is_compacted_stub() (formerly private to scripts.checks.decisions.
validate_decision_entry_conformance, now a module-level alias back to it) to public status here,
alongside its status-half bold_status()/status_is_superseded() and the new derive_currency() --
the single derivation scripts.decisions_index projects as each live row's `currency` field and
scripts.checks.decisions.validate_decision_currency enforces (DAF-03: one derivation, several
consumers, never a re-derived regex).
