"""READ-ONLY MCP stdio server projecting DuckLake NAMED_READS as agent tools (T0.8, Decision 81 cl.2).

On startup, calls DuckLakeReader.describe() ONCE and projects one MCP tool per returned verb -- the
tool list is DERIVED from the warehouse's own registry, never hand-maintained: adding a verb to
NAMED_READS surfaces a new tool automatically, with zero edits to this module. Projects nothing
else: no write verb, no infra/probe action, and no raw-SQL parameter (Decision 84 I-3 -- the
named-verb boundary only). A failed describe() at startup RAISES; there is no fallback to a
hardcoded verb list (Decision 55).

WRITE LEG DEFERRED (operator decision, round-1 plan critique): the write verbs' only prospective
bound was a module-level Python literal inside this agent-editable server, which is weaker than the
in-handler guard Decision 143 requires. This module therefore projects reads only.

KNOWN LIMITATION: the tool list is fetched once at process startup (stdio transport is one process
per session) -- a verb added to NAMED_READS after this process started surfaces only on the next
session (server restart). The derivation property still holds; freshness is per-session, not live.
