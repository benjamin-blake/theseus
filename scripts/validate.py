"""Local CI validation script. Run before every commit.

Runs validation checks that mirror the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.
Default (no flags) runs the full check suite. Use --pre for fast lint/format
checks only during implementation.

Thin CLI (Decision 104, dispatch rewired to per-domain manifests by Decision 169): every check
lives in scripts/checks/<domain>/ and is tagged in the scripts/checks/registry.py check registry,
dispatched via registry.resolve(name) -- never a facade re-export in this file. This file retains
only the argparse surface, the recursion/branch guards, the fast-tier budget assertion, the
non-check scaffolding steps (lint, precommit, mypy, explicit pytest, unit-test invoke_step,
dependency/terraform gates), and re-exports of the shared _common/_scaffolding primitives (back-compat
for `patch("validate.<primitive>")` and `from scripts.validate import <primitive>`).
