"""mcp__github__ payload normalization and pure oracles for the drain runbook (Decision 76).

A Python process cannot call MCP tools -- the agent calls mcp__github__actions_list /
actions_get / get_job_logs / actions_run_trigger between CLI invocations and hands this module
the raw JSON payload. Everything here is pure: normalize the payload's real shape (measured live,
not assumed from the gh CLI it replaces) to this module's internal shape, then decide.

Four measured shape hazards this module exists to close (rec-3381): the real payload uses `id`,
never `databaseId`; `created_at`, never `createdAt`; list_workflow_jobs double-nests as
{"jobs": {"jobs": [...]}}; and get_job_logs' real envelope is flat -- {job_id, logs_content,
message, original_length} -- with no logs[] array and no job_name key (the shape this module's own
planning context predicted before the payload was actually captured and measured).
