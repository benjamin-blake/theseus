"""Read-only plan scope registration-closure engine plus its advisory CLI (plan-obligation-closure).

Derives which of docs/contracts/plan-obligations.yaml's `registration_surfaces` obligations a
plan's `scope` rows have or have not satisfied. Holds no second copy of the obligation map --
every rule (trigger pattern, required companion paths) is read from the contract at check time,
never hardcoded here.

Reads plans as PLAIN YAML (schema_version/plan_type/scope only), not through the strict
scripts.roadmap.plan_document.PlanDocument loader: registration closure is structurally derivable
from those three fields alone, and validate_plan_documents already separately owns full-schema
validity. This also lets the engine evaluate a minimal in-memory fixture dict (the graduated VP
steps in this plan build fixtures from inline dicts, not full PlanDocument-valid ones) without
tripping on unrelated required fields.

Exception-contained throughout: scripts/checks/validation_result.py calls a check's function with
no try/except, so an unhandled raise here would abort the whole --pre/full tier and skip
write_completed_visible, destroying CI-RCA's attribution substrate. A missing/malformed contract
or an unreadable/malformed plan yields a reported finding string, never an exception.

The sole registered check (scripts/checks/roadmap/validate_plan_scope_closure.py) is a thin
delegate over this module's `evaluate_plan`/`net_new_v4_implementation_plan_paths`. This module
also exposes an advisory CLI: `bin/venv-python -m scripts.roadmap.plan_obligations --plan <path>`
always exits 0, including when the plan has unmet obligations -- the registered check is the
gate, this CLI is a report.
