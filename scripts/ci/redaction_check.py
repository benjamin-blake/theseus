"""Public-repo redaction helper for the speculative-plan PR comment (Decision 101 boundary).

Two modes, both fail closed:

redact
    stdin is the raw ``terraform show`` text. Replaces the tfvars-sourced secrets (env
    ``_ACCT``/``_DEV``/``_ADM``/``_OWNER``) with placeholders, then fails if a 12-digit
    account-id-shaped TOKEN survives. The shape check belongs HERE, on untrusted terraform
    output, and nowhere else.

assert-clean
    stdin is the final comment body. Fails if any secret literal appears anywhere in it.
    Deliberately NO shape check: the body embeds hex identifiers -- the saved-plan sha256 digest
    and the 40-hex PR head SHA -- whose digit runs false-positive the account-id shape. That is
    the 2026-08-30 REDACTION_FAIL on PR #975, where digest ...f740037807611c... contained twelve
    digits bounded by hex letters and the job failed with the account id correctly redacted.

``_ACCT`` is required non-empty in both modes: an empty account id means the tfvars parse failed,
and replace-based redaction would silently no-op exactly when redaction matters most.

``owner_email`` is scrubbed alongside the account id and the two ExternalIds because
``terraform/personal/main.tf`` sets ``default_tags { Owner = var.owner_email }``, so a destroy plan
prints it on every tagged resource.
