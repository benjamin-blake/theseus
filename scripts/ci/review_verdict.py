"""Testable verdict classifier for the sandbox subagent plan-review step (T2.39, rec-2658 forward-fix).

Classifies a `claude -p --output-format json` transcript into exactly one of three
mutually-exclusive classes:

  PROCEED -- the reviewer emitted an explicit apply-eligible verdict. Apply proceeds.
  REVISE  -- the reviewer emitted an explicit rejection. Fail closed: the convergence record
             write step sets status=red.
  STARVED -- the reviewer exhausted its turn budget, produced no parseable verdict, or the CLI
             invocation itself failed (max-turns, empty/no-token result, API error). This blocks
             auto-apply and files a labelled rec, but MUST NEVER be treated as an implicit REVISE
             (that would mask a reviewer-infrastructure failure as a plan rejection) and MUST
             NEVER be treated as an implicit PROCEED (fail-open, unsafe). The record-write step
             gates on this class via a REVIEW_STARVED marker and does not write red for it
             (Decision 55 anti-masking).

rec-2658 root cause: scripts/ci/claude_p_retry.sh redirects both stdout and stderr into the same
output file (`claude -p "$@" > "$OUTPUT_FILE" 2>&1`). A max-turns/no-verdict run -- precisely the
STARVED class this module exists to detect -- is exactly when CLI/npm diagnostic lines are most
likely to surround the JSON result object. classify() therefore never assumes the file is clean
JSON: it locates the LAST well-formed top-level JSON object in the text (tolerating leading,
trailing, or interleaved non-JSON noise) before inspecting it, and falls back to a raw-text token
scan only when no such object exists at all.

classify() is a pure function of its input string -- no I/O, no side effects -- so the
PROCEED/REVISE/STARVED partition is unit-provable (tests/test_review_verdict.py).
