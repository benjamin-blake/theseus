# Body of pr-conflict-signal.yml's poll step, extracted from the workflow (rec-2735) so the logic
# is directly testable and every gh call handles its own exit status explicitly -- a gh failure on
# one PR must never truncate the sweep or be mistaken for a legitimate empty result.
#
# ERREXIT, PRECISELY (verified empirically; see this repo's plan history for the full derivation).
# The workflow step that invokes this script declares no `shell:` key, so GitHub runs the step's
# own run: body as "bash --noprofile --norc -e -o pipefail {0}" -- but that body is now just
# `bash scripts/ci/pr_conflict_signal.sh`, which spawns a CHILD bash process. A child bash does
# NOT inherit its parent's shell options (SHELLOPTS is unexported), so THIS script runs WITHOUT
# inherited errexit: an unhandled gh failure here does not abort the script, it yields an empty
# string that silently falls through to "no wake needed" unless every call site explicitly checks
# its own exit status -- which is the fix below. `set +e` is retained near the top purely as
# defence-in-depth against a future re-inlining of this body back into the workflow step (where -e
# WOULD apply); it is not the load-bearing mechanism.
#
# Contract with pr-conflict-signal.yml: cwd is the repo root (actions/checkout precedes this
# step); GH_TOKEN / GH_REPO are set in the step's env: block for the gh CLI to read.

# call SUCCEEDS but its captured stdout equals it, is ALSO retried (the mergeable poll passes
# "UNKNOWN"); pass "" to retry on call failure only. Prints the last observed stdout (possibly
# empty or stale) and returns 0 only when the final attempt both succeeded AND (retry_on_value is
# "" or stdout != retry_on_value) -- so a caller can always distinguish "call failed" from
# "call succeeded but returned the retry sentinel" by inspecting the printed value.
