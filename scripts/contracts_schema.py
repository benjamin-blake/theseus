"""Canonical Pydantic v2 schema for the pre-codegen contract ritual (T-1.12 subset d).

Models the Class A/B/C `docs/contracts/{name}.yaml` ritual contract shape defined in
docs/INTENT-pre-codegen-contract-ratification.md Parts 3C-3E and Part 4 Invariants 1-6.

Split out from scripts/contracts.py (the loader/resolver public API) to keep each module
under the 500-SLOC gate (Decision 43). The loader imports these models; the subset-(e) CI
drift gate imports the ContractStatus / ChangeClass / ContractClass enums from HERE, not
from contracts.py.

Import safety: defining enums and models performs no I/O and raises nothing at import time.
All validation is deferred to explicit model construction inside load_contract / resolve_refs.
