"""Deterministic guard for the sandbox auto-apply pipeline (Decision 77).

Parses `terraform show -json <planfile>` output and decides whether the plan is safe to
auto-apply in the sandbox environment without a human in the loop. The guard is the fail-closed
plan-CONTENT control (Decision 77 / CD.35): it, together with a subagent plan review, IS the
apply gate. Branch protection is now active (main-protection ruleset, Decision 83 / CD.20) but
deliberately non-wedging -- the guard + review remain the content gate. It MUST fail closed.

Exit codes (consumed by .github/workflows/terraform-apply-sandbox.yml):
  0  plan is safe: only create / update / no-op / read on non-IAM resources, no trust diffs, and
     any neon_* change is a pure create / no-op / read; an in-budget IAM inline-policy /
     attachment UPDATE on a managed boundary-carrying role (T2.25 / Decision 92 point 5); OR a
     resource-based-policy change matching the known-safe EventBridge invoke shape (T2.45 /
     DEP-06).
  2  plan is BLOCKED: contains a destroy, a replacement, a trust-policy (assume_role_policy) diff,
     an out-of-budget IAM-sensitive change, a non-create neon_* change, or a resource-based-policy
     change (Lambda permission, S3/SNS/Secrets-Manager/Glue resource policy, Lambda function URL)
     that is not the known-safe EventBridge shape (T2.45 / DEP-06). Requires a manual admin apply
     or a gated-apply Environment approval.
  1  internal / parse error (also blocks apply at the workflow level).

--digest mode (T2.39 / rec-2658 forward-fix): `terraform_apply_guard.py --digest <plan.json>`
  prints a bounded, decision-relevant plan summary to stdout and exits 0 (parse errors still
  exit 1). Reuses this module's own resource_changes traversal (build_digest -> _digest_entries)
  so the digest can never drift from the verdict evaluate_plan() computes. Consumed by the
  sandbox subagent plan-review step, which pipes the digest on stdin instead of handing the
  reviewer a bare plan.json filename to read itself (rec-2658 root cause: reading the full
  terraform show -json dump burned the entire turn budget before a verdict was reached). Bounded
  to _DIGEST_SIZE_CAP bytes with an explicit truncation marker on overflow, redacts AWS ARNs /
  12-digit account ids (Decision 101 public-content boundary) before it ever reaches stdout, and
  leads with a reviewer-hardening preamble (T2.45) stating the digest content is DATA, not
  instructions -- the digest is plan-derived text handed to a subagent reviewer, so it is treated
  as untrusted input, not a source of directives.

Detection contract (against `terraform show -json`, iterating .resource_changes[]):
  - BLOCK if .change.actions contains "delete" (covers ["delete"] destroys and the replacement
    pairs ["delete","create"] / ["create","delete"]).
  - BLOCK if .type is a neon_* resource AND .change.actions is not a pure ["create"]/["no-op"]/
    ["read"] (T2.16b / CD.34). The DuckLake catalog is the lakehouse's single point of total
    failure, so its third-party Neon resources auto-apply only as pure creates. An update is where
    an IP allow-list widening / role-credential rotation / project-setting change would land;
    delete + replace are already blocked by the rule above. A create is allowed on the strength of
    compensating controls (enforced TLS sslmode=require + a scoped neon_role + the DSN in Secrets
    Manager), NOT an IP allow-list -- Neon IP-Allow is Scale-plan-only and unavailable on the free
    tier, and egress here is dynamic (REPORT R3 / CD.34). The compensating controls are enforced in
    neon_ducklake_catalog.tf, not introspected here, so the guard stays robust against the
    sensitive/unknown attribute values a Neon create reports at plan time.
  - BLOCK if a trust attribute (assume_role_policy) differs between .change.before and
    .change.after on ANY resource. assume_role_policy is serialised as a JSON-encoded string, so
    it is normalised via json.loads before comparison (key-order/whitespace differences do not
    cause nuisance trips). Trust check runs BEFORE IAM classification (T2.25) so a trust diff on
    a managed role is always gated, never slips through as an in-budget update.
  - PASS (in-budget) if .type is in in_budget_resource_types, every .change.actions entry is an
    in_budget_action (SUBSET membership, budget v2 -- ["create","update"] admits a lone
    ["create"] or ["update"]; a replace pair such as ["delete","create"] is never a subset and
    stays gated), AND the target role (.change.after.role or .change.before.role) is a managed
    boundary-carrying role -- matched against in_budget_managed_role_prefix (a boundary-carrying
    agent-platform-* prefix, budget v2 / Decision 92 point 5 / Decision 144), with a fail-safe
    fallback to the v1 enumerated in_budget_managed_roles when no prefix is present. The apply
    role itself (agent-platform-github-ci-apply) is ALWAYS self-excluded: the widened prefix
    matches its own name, so an inline-policy write on it must never auto-apply -- the guard-side
    counterpart to github_ci_apply.tf's DenySelfInlinePolicyWrite (T2.23 self-grant break). Budget
    table loaded from terraform/bootstrap/authority_budget.json (override via TF_AUTHORITY_BUDGET
    env var). Missing or unparseable table = fail closed (all IAM treated as out-of-budget,
    Decision 77). This is a predicate widening to read the v2 budget shape -- NO new classification
    stage; the fail-closed control theory is retained verbatim.
  - BLOCK if .type is IAM-sensitive AND .change.actions is not ["no-op"]/["read"] AND not in-budget.
  - RESOURCE-POLICY stage (T2.45 / DEP-06), evaluated LAST (after IAM classification, so a delete
    or trust diff on one of these types is still caught by the earlier rules above): a non-inert
    change on aws_lambda_permission, aws_s3_bucket_policy, aws_sns_topic_policy,
    aws_secretsmanager_secret_policy, aws_glue_resource_policy, or aws_lambda_function_url BLOCKS,
    UNLESS it is the one known-safe shape -- an aws_lambda_permission whose principal ==
    "events.amazonaws.com" (exact), action == "lambda:InvokeFunction" (exact), AND function_name
    starts with "agent-platform-", ALL THREE conjunctively (the routine EventBridge-rule-invokes-
    Lambda wiring pattern; see terraform/personal/ducklake_maintenance.tf and prod_lambdas.tf).
    This is an allowlist, not a denylist: any other principal (including "*", an external account,
    or "s3.amazonaws.com" -- e.g. the existing S3-triggered permissions in prod_lambdas.tf), a
    missing/unparseable principal, a wrong action, or a non-agent-platform-prefixed function_name
    all BLOCK. The other five types have no auto-apply shape at all and always BLOCK on a
    non-inert change.
