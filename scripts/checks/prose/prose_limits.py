"""Ambient agent-instruction prose byte-budget ratchet (Decision 43/127; realizes rec-432/433).

Gates the permanent prose surface classes over Decision 127's taxonomy: S1 (root ambient
load-set aggregate: CLAUDE.md + transitive @-imports), S2 (each non-root **/CLAUDE.md), S4 (each
.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md entry file), and S8 (docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md). S3
(.claude/commands/*.md) is measured-only (Decision 127 strongest-layer surface) and carries no
budget entry here.

Byte measurement is entirely delegated to scripts.preflight.prose_context.measure_prose_context()
-- this module never re-implements the read/measure step, so this gate and the preflight advisory
report can never silently diverge on what "current bytes" means for a surface.

Unlike the SLOC gate's relief valve (decompose into a facade package), fragmenting ambient prose
across more @-imported files does NOT reduce the ambient load an agent must read -- it spreads the
same bytes across more files (Decision 114/110 anti-fragmentation). FAIL messages here therefore
never suggest that; they name three different relief valves instead: relocate the content to L2
(docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) or a docs/contracts/*.yaml contract (Decision 86 routing), defer detail
to an uncapped auxiliary file the surface points at rather than inlines, or take a loud,
Decision-cited budget raise (Decision 128's marker mechanism, reused here for the raise-gate
mechanism only -- never for its decompose-by-default relief valve, which is SLOC-specific).
