file already re-exports scripts/checks/_terraform.py and _budget_recs.py.

requirements-fast.txt (the pr-validate CI job) deliberately omits heavy wheels
(torch/pandas/numpy/pyarrow/duckdb/etc, ~3GB dominant per .github/workflows/ci.yml:49-59).
A handful of test files import one of these at module scope, so they can never be
collected under the fast tier -- that is a structural, not a regression, signal (Google
TAP / Bazel precedent: SKIPPED-dep-unavailable is distinct from FAILED). The classifier
below positively identifies that ONE shape and defers it to main-validate (full tier,
post-merge); every other collection error or test failure stays hard-red (fail-closed).

    per-file loop; net-funds the affected-set derivation's added cost inside the 5-min budget).
