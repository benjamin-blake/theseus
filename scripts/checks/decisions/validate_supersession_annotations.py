"""Decision supersession-annotation invariant guard (DPI-01 + DPI-06 + DPI-03 extension,
audits/decision-log-premise-integrity-8fb581e.yaml, PLAN-decisions-supersession-guard).

A superseding Decision that ships without a forward pointer on its victim silently regrows the
"corpse pile" the decision-log-premise-integrity audit found: a reader of the victim entry has no
way to discover it was superseded. This FULL-tier check makes that a mechanical, standing
regression guard (registered post-merge, RCA-looped per Decision 72 -- never a pre-merge --pre
block, since it does a heavier both-file parse and belongs with the other decision-corpus
full-tier checks).

Parses docs/DECISIONS.md + docs/DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md via the shared scripts.decisions_md grammar
(_iter_decision_sections, the '#{2,3}' regex from Decision 134's DAF-03 consolidation) -- never a
hand-rolled header regex, so this stays in lockstep with the ETL and the R1 ratification guard
(Decision 105). Three sub-checks:

  (a) Supersession forward-pointer (DPI-01): every textual "Supersedes/amends/partially
      supersedes Decision N" cross-reference must leave the superseder's number on the victim's
      block (plain "Decision {superseder}" or a "(Superseded by Decision {superseder})" header),
      unless the edge is listed in config/decision_supersession_waivers.yaml.
  (b) Duplicate-number detection (DPI-06 part a): the same decision number heading twice within
      one file is a FAIL; the same number appearing in both DECISIONS.md and DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md
      is a WARN, silenced by the waiver file's live_archive_pair_allowlist.
  (c) Warehouse-ID conformance (DPI-03 extension): every "**Warehouse ID:** dec-NNN" line must
      equal dec-{header:03d} for its own block's header number.

Documented, spec-accepted regex limits: the edge regex matches only the singular "Supersedes
Decision N" form (the plural "Supersedes Decisions N, M" form is not matched), and the
block-owner=superseder heuristic can mis-attribute a cited edge (e.g. a rationale that quotes
another Decision's supersession sentence) -- both are handled by the waiver file, not by
regex cleverness. A waived edge that later becomes annotated is a WARN (stale waiver), never a
FAIL, to avoid waiver-rot build breaks.
