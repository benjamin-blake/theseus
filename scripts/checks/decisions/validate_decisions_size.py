"""DECISIONS.md / DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md per-entry authoring-size governance (Decision 167 clause 3;
the module's three mechanical stock ceilings -- the live '## Decision' header count, the
live-byte-only ceiling, and the live+archive combined byte ceiling -- are RETIRED by Decision 179).

Bounded decision-scout retrieval (PLAN-decision-scout-bounded-retrieval) means no consumer reads
the live corpus wholesale anymore, so the stock guards that sized that read no longer have a
referent; Decision 150's significance bar is the retained lever on entry count and triage quality.
This check survives as the per-NEW-entry authoring size norm enforcer
(docs/contracts/decision-entry.yaml size_governance.per_entry_size_norm, Decision 167 clause 3,
rec-2934): a new-in-diff decision entry over the cap HARD-FAILS in the --pre tier. Historical
entries are never measured by that sub-check (forward-only, mirrors
validate_decision_entry_conformance's own new-vs-baseline scope). Since this check is registered
UNGATED in the --pre tier (unlike the glob-gated conformance check), the per-entry sub-check's own
(git-cost) baseline read is skipped whenever a non-default `root` is injected for testing --
production calls (the default root) pay it only when a DECISIONS file changed in this diff.

rec-3243 adds a WARN-tier-only accretion signal alongside the per-entry cap, meeting the
in-place-amendment channel the per-entry cap's forward-only scope cannot reach: an amendment-delta
leg (a BASELINE entry whose body byte-span changed and whose new span now exceeds the cap) and a
standing-pressure leg (one aggregate line naming how many live entries sit over 1.2x the cap).
Both legs are telemetry -- they NEVER append to `failed` -- and sit downstream of this module's
existing hard-fail cap and cost gate.
