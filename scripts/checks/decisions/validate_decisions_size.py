"""DECISIONS.md / DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md size governance (Decision 134; Decision-114 parity;
live-byte ceiling RETIRED by PLAN-decision-scout-bounded-retrieval, per Decision 145's own
reversal conditions -- the decision-scout gate no longer reads the live file wholesale, so the
ceiling that guard existed to size no longer has a referent).

Ratifies a conscious ceiling + deterministic guard for the decision log, mirroring
scripts/checks/roadmap/validate_platform_roadmap.py's _roadmap_size_issues() precedent
(Decision 114). Two ceilings survive the retirement: a live '## Decision' header count (the
decision-scout gate's `M`, Decision 134) and a live+archive combined byte ceiling, which now
backstops docs/DECISIONS.md's size on its own (Decision 151 consequence). Both are cheap,
structural, and independent of how the decision-scout gate reads the corpus.

PLAN-decision-entry-flow-governance / Decision 167 adds a third ceiling: a forward-only per-NEW-entry
authoring size norm (docs/contracts/decision-entry.yaml size_governance.per_entry_size_norm,
rec-2934). Decision 167 clause 3 explicitly dated this as a WARN-tier pre-commitment, staged
behind migration step 3 (destination readiness) -- migration-step-3-grandfathering IS that
migration step, so this norm now HARD-FAILS: a new-in-diff entry over the cap appends to `failed`.
Historical entries are still never measured (forward-only, mirrors
validate_decision_entry_conformance's own new-vs-baseline scope). Since this check is registered
UNGATED in the --pre tier (unlike the glob-gated conformance check), the per-entry sub-check's own
(git-cost) baseline read is skipped whenever a non-default `root` is injected for testing --
production calls (the default root) always pay it, since the two stock ceilings below already
read both files on every --pre run regardless.

    (PLAN-decision-scout-bounded-retrieval) -- it existed solely to size the decision-scout
