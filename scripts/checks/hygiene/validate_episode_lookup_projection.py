"""Flags a module that filters a `named("<verb>")` RESULT on a key that verb does not project
(rec-3291 / rec-3563 class guard, Decision 170).

Root cause this guards against: a call site binds `X = reader.named("<verb>")` and later filters
an element of `X` on a key (`elem.get("key")` / `elem["key"]`) the verb's declared projection
(src.common.ducklake_reader_client.VERB_FIELDS) does not include -- the exact shape that made
scripts.convergence_health.escalate's pre-migration dedup lookup filter `source`/`status` against
`open_recs`, a verb that projects neither, so the filter always matched nothing.

DATA-FLOW linked, not module-level co-occurrence: the scan is per-function-scope. It tracks a
local `name = X.named("<verb>", ...)` assignment (or the `X.named(...) or []` fallback idiom),
then looks ONLY at accesses on names bound to an ELEMENT of that list within the SAME function
(a `for elem in name:` loop, or a `[... for elem in name ...]` comprehension) -- never at
accesses anywhere else in the module or file. Two real consequences of that scoping choice
(verified against this repo's tree, not assumed):

  * scripts/preflight/recs_cache.py's two named()-adjacent filters never connect: the
    `named("open_recs")` result at one call site is passed onward to `_tally_rec_counts`
    unfiltered, and the `status == "open"` filters live in `_derive_open_recs` /
    `_derive_followon_recs`, which filter a `rows` FUNCTION PARAMETER (never itself assigned
    from a `named()` call in that function) -- two different data paths that happen to share a
    module, not one flagged co-occurrence.
  * scripts/ci/reconcile_target.py's `validate_rec_id_open` reads `rows[0].get("status")` from
    `rows = reader(rec_id)`, where `reader` is an injected PARAMETER, not a `named()` call in
    that function -- the closure that actually calls `.named("rec_by_id", ...)` lives in a
    DIFFERENT function (`_default_reader`'s nested `_call`). The scan's function-scope boundary
    means it never traces into that closure; it simply finds no verb bound to `rows` in
    `validate_rec_id_open`'s own scope and moves on. Tracing through such an indirection is
    deliberately out of scope for this guard -- a documented blind spot, not a claimed strength.

Four live input classes, each independently verified against the tree at authoring time:
  (a) SENTINEL verbs (`VERB_FIELDS[verb] is ALL_TABLE_COLUMNS`, e.g. `rec_by_id`) project every
      column -- checked via identity BEFORE any `in` membership test, so a sentinel entry never
      raises TypeError and is never flagged.
  (b) A verb absent from VERB_FIELDS entirely (e.g. scripts/preflight/alerts.py's
      `named('budget_breach_recent')`, which is in neither VERB_FIELDS nor NAMED_READS) is
      recorded as unresolved and never flagged -- the guard cannot judge a verb it cannot
      resolve, and refusing to guess is safer than a false negative OR a false positive.
  (c) A result reached only through a callable indirection (reconcile_target.py above) is never
      connected, by construction of the per-function scan -- not because of anything special
      about the verb it happens to use.
  (d) The migrated tree itself (post scripts.rec_episode.find_rec) filters only via
      `current_state`, which this guard does not model at all (VERB_FIELDS is `named()`-verb
      projection only) -- so the migrated call sites are invisible to this scan, correctly.

Declares examined()/skipped() on every reachable exit path (Decision 170): failed / skipped (only
unresolved verbs encountered) / vacuous (nothing found) / enforced (clean pass).
