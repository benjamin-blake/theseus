"""Licence-artefact consistency and class-(a) slug hygiene (Decision 171).

Two invariants, one check:

1. **Licence-file consistency.** LICENSE is parameterised BUSL-1.1 with every Parameter
   populated and no template placeholder surviving; LICENSE-APACHE holds the preserved
   Apache-2.0 text; LICENSING.md states the forward-only boundary and names a real
   40-hex commit; README agrees with all three.

2. **No class-(a) old-slug survivor.** The repository slug moved
   benjamin-blake/agent-platform -> benjamin-blake/theseus, but roughly twenty BARE
   `agent-platform` occurrences are AWS resource names (the `agent-platform-data-lake`
   bucket, `agent-platform-*` IAM roles, `/agent-platform/*` SSM paths, Glue database,
   Lambda names) that MUST NOT be rewritten. A repo-wide grep cannot express that, so
   this check carries an explicit path -> PATTERN map.

WHY THE PATTERN IS PER-PATH AND NOT ONE SHARED REGEX. The three classes are genuinely
different shapes, and collapsing them yields either a vacuous pass or a permanent red:

  - `escalate.py` needs FULL-SLUG matching: line 39 is class-(a) (`repos/<owner>/<slug>`)
    while lines 43 and 47 carry `s3://agent-platform-data-lake` in the SAME file. A
    bare-token pattern would flag the bucket forever.
  - `approvals.py` needs BARE-TOKEN matching: its defaults are `repo: str = "agent-platform"`
    with no owner prefix. A full-slug pattern would never match, passing vacuously.
  - `bin/setup-cloud-env.sh` needs a CONTEXT-QUALIFIED pattern: line 61's PAT scope is
    class-(a), but line 38's `cd /home/user/agent-platform` is an on-disk checkout path
    (rename-independent) and line 205's `s3://agent-platform-data-lake` is class-(b). A
    bare-token pattern matches all three, because `-` is a word boundary.

Decision 170: this check declares examined()/skipped() rather than relying on the frozen
check-accounting baseline. A pass with examined(0) is a VACUOUS pass -- the path map is
wrong or empty -- which is exactly what the declarative channel exists to make visible.
