"""Verification graduation completeness gate (T3.21, VF-05 enforcement, re-keyed to content
resolution -- see the amendment on Decision 132/148 in docs/DECISIONS.md).

VF-05 (T3.18) shipped the graduation PRODUCER (the implement skill's Tier_item bookkeeping
walk graduates a plan's own kernel-expressible VP steps into a new
config/agent/verification_registry/entries/<check_id>.yaml shard) and VF-06 (validate_verification_registry's
real differential admission gate). Neither one is an OBLIGATION: nothing forces a fix PR to
actually add the registry row it owes, so a skip is invisible to CI (a plan-PR incident, PR
#586, shipped 4 orphaned checks -- no new registry entries, so "correctly graduated nothing"
looked identical to "forgot to graduate"). This check closes that gap by enforcing the plan's
OWN declared graduation dispositions across two legs:

  Plan-PR leg: a diff-added or diff-modified docs/plans/PLAN-*.yaml must carry a graduation
    disposition (graduate|waive|not-applicable) on every pre-deploy VP step -- field presence
    only, no kernel-expressibility inference (that classification judgement is the fresh-context
    plan-critique gate's job, at plan time). Enforced only when the plan is net-new in the diff
    (git diff --diff-filter=A) OR it already declares >=1 disposition somewhere -- a merely-
    modified plan that declares zero dispositions anywhere (a correction to a pre-field plan, or
    the lagged .yaml archival sweep) is a pre-field plan and is skipped, not failed.

  Implement leg: resolves plans via `_common.resolve_declared_plans` (content-keyed: an
    edge-triggered `implementation_declared` False->True flip between the diff base and the
    working tree), loads each resolved PLAN-{slug}.yaml, and asserts every VP step declared
    graduate produced a matching NEW-in-diff registry row (plan_slug == slug AND
    check_id == graduation_check_id). waive/not-applicable steps require no row. A step whose
    graduation proved impossible at implement time is expected to have been flipped to waive
    (with a reason) in the same PR -- that flip satisfies this leg with no row.

Fail-loud (Decision 55) on genuine errors (a schema-import failure). Advisory SKIP (never a
failure): origin/main is unreachable (no fetch, detached clone, etc) -- skips the WHOLE implement
leg (content resolution cannot tell a flip from a pre-existing declaration without a reachable
base). One terminal Decision 170 declaration per dispatch (docs/contracts/check-accounting.yaml):
no plan present in the diff at all is an empty domain (`examined(0)`, never skipped); a
diff-present plan set with an unreachable base declares `skipped`; otherwise
`examined(len(resolved), unit="declared_plans")`.

Both of this check's own diff baselines -- `_default_baseline_registry_entries` and
`_added_plan_paths` -- take their base as an injected parameter, defaulted at this module's call
site from `push_context_base(root) or "origin/main"` -- paired with the SAME `root` the base is
then evaluated against -- so neither silently computes an empty added-row/added-plan set on the
post-merge main run (where a hardcoded `origin/main` literal equals HEAD) NOR reads the real
repository's push-context base while operating on an injected (e.g. fixture) `root` (rec-3166:
the root seam had no paired base seam).

Injection seams (changed_files, root, load_plan, baseline_registry_reader) mirror the
validate_vp_replay / validate_sloc_budget_raises precedents for testability without real git
state, except where a seam would defeat the point of the test (content resolution and the
net-new-plan-path predicate use real `git log` / `git diff` against `root` -- tests set up a
throwaway repo with a `refs/remotes/origin/main` ref, mirroring tests/test_verification_graduation.py).

scripts/verification_checks.py (the six-slot CD.29 kernel) is never touched here -- this check
is diff-scoped plan/registry parsing only; it never re-runs a differential (that stays owned by
validate_verification_registry / VF-06).
