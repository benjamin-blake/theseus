"""Implement-scope diff-vs-plan boundary check (Decision 59's deterministic scope guard,
docs/contracts/implement-scope-boundary.yaml).

Discharges Decision 59 ("scope guard becomes a deterministic diff-vs-plan check"): for every
implement-leg plan resolved via ``_common.resolve_declared_plans`` (content-keyed:
``implementation_declared`` newly true in this diff, mirrors validate_vp_replay), every touched
path in the diff must be a member of the resolved plan(s)' declared ``scope[].file`` union, or a
path derived from a ``docs/contracts/implement-scope-boundary.yaml`` ``sanction_rows`` entry whose
trigger fired for that plan. It also flags a prohibited edit to a resolved plan's own scope-
governing fields (``scope``, ``acceptance_criteria``, ``verification_plan[].command``/``.expected``)
-- the CONTENT invariant's plan-field-edit and VP-step-substitution enforcement arms.

Legs (mirrors validate_vp_replay's structure):
  Plan-only leg: a diff-present ``docs/plans/PLAN-*.yaml`` whose ``implementation_declared`` did
    NOT newly flip true DEFERS -- prints a DEFER line, enforces nothing for that plan.
  Enforcing leg: for every resolved plan, unions its declared scope, derives its sanctioned
    companions from the contract's ``sanction_rows``, and checks every path in ``changed_files``
    against (declared scope) union (derived sanctions). It also diffs the resolved plan's own
    content against its base-ref content for a prohibited field edit.

Seam: ``changed_files`` is derived from ``_common.get_status_aware_diff`` (its untracked-``??``
leg is the only primitive that sees a Created scope row before the commit flow runs; its "D"
rows are the only primitive that surfaces a deleted path at all -- a deleted path outside scope
is a known, named gap the contract records: get_changed_files existence-filters it away, so the
seam choice here decides whether a deletion is even visible). Never globs docs/plans/ -- plans are
derived one hop off the diff via ``_common.plan_paths_from_changed``.

Injection seams (``plan_paths``/``changed_files``/``root``), accepted UNFILTERED (the
validate_plan_scope_closure precedent): when ``plan_paths`` is given, it IS the resolved
implement-leg set directly -- no diff-derivation, no DEFER printing, no vacuous/skipped legs. This
is what lets a plan's own Verification Plan dispatch the enforcing leg against its own working
tree before anything is committed (ambient resolution would see no flip yet, since
``implementation_declared`` is set only at the commit-flow step).

A malformed contract or plan is a reported finding, never a raise (Decision 55: fail loud via
``failed``, not an uncaught exception). A ``sanction_rows`` entry naming a ``trigger.kind`` this
module does not implement is a loud failure, never a silently-skipped row.
