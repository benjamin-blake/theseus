          when its covers intersect the diff, this is the designed backstop for that hole -- run
          the real fail-on-revert differential instead of skipping unconditionally.
      (c) No covered file appears in the diff (the author is changing only the verifier,
          not any guarded target).

    This diff's own plan paths never count as covered -- the CANDIDATE set
    ``_common.plan_paths_from_changed`` returns for the changed set. Sanction row
    ``implementing_plan_bookkeeping`` in docs/contracts/implement-scope-boundary.yaml already
    holds a plan document to be a bookkeeping companion of its own implement diff rather than
    code. The candidate set is deliberate rather than that contract's derived one because
    ``implementation_declared`` flips only in the commit flow, so the derived set is empty while
    this check runs. This REFINES what counts as covered and is not a further exception beside
    (b) and (c): a verifier changed alongside any real covered source file still violates.
