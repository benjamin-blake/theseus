"""Bounded execution and replay outcome reporting for validate_vp_replay's shared-aggregate
deadline model (docs/contracts/vp-red-before.yaml's ``replay_bound``) and its GREEN-AFTER/
red-before divergence text (docs/contracts/vp-red-before.yaml's ``green_leg_labels``). Private
sibling of validate_vp_replay.py (Decision 104 precedent: _vp_replay_classify.py) -- 18+
graduated registry rows name validate_vp_replay.py as ``guard_target``, so a facade-package
conversion (Decision 128's default) would retire a live path out from under them.

``run_bounded`` executes a replayed VP step's command against a wall-clock deadline, in its own
process group (``start_new_session=True``): on ``TimeoutExpired`` -- or any ``BaseException``
raised while waiting, since ``start_new_session`` detaches the child from the caller's foreground
group and would otherwise orphan it -- the whole process group is SIGKILLed and reaped with a
BOUNDED wait, so a descendant that escaped via setsid while holding the pipe can never hang this
check with no deadline. POSIX-only by design (``os.killpg``, ``start_new_session``): every surface
that runs this check is Linux (CC-web, CI). Accepted residual: a SIGTERM/SIGKILL delivered to the
validate process itself (no Python exception raised) orphans a still-running step's process group
-- bounded at job end on CI runners, unbounded locally only for a genuinely hung step.

The remaining helpers are pure telemetry, never a source of truth: a replayed PASS line's duration
suffix, the one terminal per-dispatch summary line, the two deadline-kill failure-text builders
(green leg and red-before leg), and the advisory warn band (never appends to a check's ``failed``
list -- WARN only, docs/contracts/vp-red-before.yaml's ``replay_bound``). The aggregate is always
passed in by the caller, never read from this module, so the existing
``validate_vp_replay.MAX_AGGREGATE_SECONDS`` patch seam keeps binding.
