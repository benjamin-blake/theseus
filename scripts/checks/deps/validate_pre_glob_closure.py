"""BLOCKING auditor: does each glob-gated --pre check's pre_globs cover its own code closure?

Motivating defect class (D2-3 Finding 4, rec-3289): a `--pre` Entry declares `pre_globs`, the
check's implementation then grows a transitive first-party import that none of those globs match,
and from that moment a diff touching the new input silently SKIPS the check in the fast tier.
Under-inclusion in a gate input is fail-OPEN, which Decision 135's posture forbids. Waves 1 and 2
found 12 such defective globs BY HAND; this check finds them mechanically.

What it does NOT do (the rejected framing): it does not replace `pre_globs` with a runtime
derivation. The manifest stays the single greppable, statically-auditable declaration -- Decision
169's audit surface is untouched and no gate input becomes a runtime computation. Measured reason:
over the FULL graph `nx.descendants()` returns an identical closure for every check module in the
repo, because Decision 169's contractual manifest -> check bare-string-literal edge collapses every
gated check into one strongly-connected component. A derived glob would therefore say "every .py
under src/ and scripts/" for all of them -- selection-identical to deleting `pre_globs`.

So the closure is taken over IMPORT-KIND EDGES ONLY (scripts.dependency_graph.import_subgraph),
which leaves the driver edge in the graph for the selection derivation that needs it while giving
this auditor the code-level view it needs. Honest accounting of the trade: this substitutes one
hand-maintained surface (`_PRUNED_EDGES`) for part of another. It is justified because that list
is a tested declaration carrying a stated reason per entry, and because a wrong entry reddens a
build rather than silently narrowing selection.

Staging (D2-3 migration path, now COMPLETE -- LSA-06). Wave 4a was ADVISORY on both channels
(printed findings, declared Decision 170 accounting, never appended to `failed`). Wave 4b paid the
backlog down: a genuinely missing glob got added, an Entry.module naming no graph node got
corrected, a hub artefact got a reviewed `_PRUNED_EDGES` entry, and a derived structural floor
(see `_module_body_is_trivial`) excluded modules with nothing to declare. Wave 4c -- THIS module,
now -- is the flip: an uncovered closure path APPENDS to `failed`, the same as any other --pre
gate. The genuine backlog measured zero across all seven affected domain manifests before this
flip landed (see the seven `scripts/checks/*/_manifest.py` paydowns in the same diff).

_PRUNED_EDGES additions are themselves change-controlled (rec-3558): a brand-new row, or an
existing row's target count growing, requires a `# pruned-edge-approved: dec-NNN <reason>` marker
on the row's own line span, checked by `_marker_guard.check_diff` against a `RegistrySpec` declared
in THIS module (never `_marker_guard.py` itself -- a new binding needs no edit there). Removing a
row, or shrinking one, is always free -- only WIDENING the auditor's blind spot is gated.
