"""Fast-tier budget formula, constants and plan-time reporter (Decision 208, amends Decision 182).

The single home of every budget constant the fast tier asserts on, of the three-term split those
budgets are asserted over, and of the plan-time CLI that reports a candidate scope's selection
breadth before the work is written. scripts/validate.py restates no number from here: it BINDS its
two existing public constant names to FLOOR_TOTAL_SECONDS and CEILING_SECONDS.

The tier asserts THREE quantities rather than one aggregate wall clock:

* NON_TEST_BUDGET_SECONDS on ``elapsed - phase_times[TEST_PHASE_NAME] - escalation_carve_out(...)``
  -- identically ``static_s + replay_s + unattributed_s`` minus the escalation carve-out, so
  nothing the tier spends is left ungoverned. Unwaivable: no bypass, forced-scope, breadth or
  fallback path reaches it.
* a measured-cost test-execution allowance on ``phase_times[TEST_PHASE_NAME]``, capped at the
  DERIVED expression ``CEILING_SECONDS - NON_TEST_BUDGET_SECONDS - PRECOMMIT_ESCALATION_ALLOWANCE_SECONDS``
  so the worst-case ASSERTED total across all three governed terms is exactly the existing derived
  ceiling -- no second ceiling constant.
* PRECOMMIT_ESCALATION_ALLOWANCE_SECONDS, carved out of the non-test half only when the pre-commit
  `--all-files` escalation (docs/contracts/presubmit-tool-pin-escalation.yaml) actually fired on
  this run -- excess above the allowance stays in the unwaivable half, so escalation adds no new
  outcome.

REPLAY_ALLOWANCE_SECONDS is neither a budget asserted here nor a term in the cap: it MIRRORS
validate_vp_replay's own ratified MAX_AGGREGATE_SECONDS ALONE -- the check's green maximum under
its shared-aggregate deadline model. It is recorded because NON_TEST_BUDGET_SECONDS was derived to
DOMINATE it -- a check sanctioned to consume the whole outer budget would make the two jointly
unsatisfiable -- and because the breach diagnostic prints replay_s beside it. It is pinned equal to
its source by a test rather than imported: importing that check's defining module here would trade
this module's stdlib purity (and validate.py's eager import of it) for a coupling the pin already
covers.

Test-half allowance, measured-cost (Decision 208 point 1, amends 182 point 1): the retired
``max(180, 2.0 x min(n_selected, census))`` never distinguished two similar-count selections of
different composition. ``cost_based_allowance`` prices the selection instead, from a per-module
junit cost table (scripts/checks/deps/module_cost_table.py) read at the merge-base with
origin/main -- so a PR cannot raise its own allowance by editing the table it is judged against.
The SAME function gates CI and predicts at plan time (Decision 208 point 1): predict_test_half and
predict_ci_elapsed take the same cost_s and the same COST_COEFFICIENT high end the gate itself
asserts on. test_execution_allowance's legacy formula is KEPT (never removed) as the fallback for
a merge-base table read that is ``absent`` -- the installing PR, and any environment with no
committed table yet.

Declare or split -- the plan-time reading of this CLI's report:
  within_budget    plan the scope as one unit; the measured breadth is already inside the base.
  breadth_waived   KEEP the scope and DECLARE the measured breadth in the plan, so the waiver is
                   expected and reviewed rather than discovered in CI.
  breach           SPLIT the scope into atomic units until the prediction clears -- the measured
                   selection breadth, not the scope-row file count, is the quantity to plan
                   against.
  non_test_breach  neither declare nor split: the non-test half is drifting, which no scope change
                   fixes; open a planning session against the recorded static_s series.
