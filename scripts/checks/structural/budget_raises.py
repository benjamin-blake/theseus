"""Structural-size budget-raise guardrail (Decision 166) -- the SIXTH CONSUMER of
scripts/checks/_marker_guard.py, never a sixth copy.

config/structural_size_budgets.yaml mixes an ordered `classes:` table (carrying scalar
keys like `limit`/`max_line_chars`) with two flat per-file rosters (`budgets:` and
`long_line_budgets:`), so this module declares TWO section-scoped RegistrySpecs over the
SAME rel_path -- THE CRITICAL SEAM: make_section_extractor anchors each spec on its own
top-level section and ends it at the next column-0 non-comment line, so neither
extraction ever captures a `classes:` block scalar as a budget entry (a flat extractor
would). Contains no local Decision-header regex, no local base reader, and no local
entry parser -- scripts.checks._marker_guard owns all of that.

Also carries frozen_base_violations() -- the BASE-AWARE half of the SGE-05 escape legs. It
lives here rather than in size_limits.py because all three of its legs read frozen-ness
from the BASE text, and this module is the one that already owns the base-versus-current
diff and its injection seam. A git-less helper structurally cannot see a DELETION, which is
exactly what the measured escapes exploit.
