"""Structural-size limit gate (SGE-01/SGE-02/SGE-04, Decision 166).

Walks scripts.checks.structural._classify.iter_measured_files(); for each governed file,
compares effective lines against its `budgets:` roster entry (else its class row's
`limit`), and its longest line against its `long_line_budgets:` roster entry (else its
class row's `max_line_chars`). Registered in BOTH presubmit tiers, unscoped (no
pre_globs) -- measured whole-tree cost is ~0.1s against Decision 73's 300s fast-tier
budget, so pre_globs machinery would cost more complexity than it saves (the
validate_sloc_limits precedent).

Also carries escape_violations() -- the STATIC half of the escape-accountability legs
(SGE-05). It answers "can this registry widen its own gate without anyone being
accountable for it": E1 pins the residual floor, E2 pins every governed class ceiling to a
per-slug mapping that lives in code rather than config, E3 makes every defer_to_incumbent
entry attributable, and E4 keeps a frozen budget note coherent with the roster it
annotates. The BASE-aware half of E4 (direction, un-freezing, newly-deferred) needs the
base-versus-current diff and therefore lives in budget_raises.py instead.

Every leg returns a LEG-LABELLED message and never raises: a governed row carrying a
non-integer limit, a missing residual row and a deleted frozen path are all reported, not
crashed on (Decision 55 -- a crash inside a presubmit check obscures which gate failed).
