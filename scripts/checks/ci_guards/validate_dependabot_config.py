"""Dependabot pip-group denylist exclusion gate (Decision 99, rec-3832).

The duckdb/DuckLake SSOT lockstep denylist lives as a literal in
`scripts/ci/dependabot_auto_merge.sh` (`_DENIED_DEPENDENCIES`) -- a bump of either name is never
auto-merged regardless of its semver class. Before this check existed, a denylisted name could
still ride inside a grouped Dependabot `minor-and-patch` update: the group as a whole would then
strand behind the denylist gate every week, blocking every OTHER dependency bumped alongside it.
`.github/dependabot.yml`'s `exclude-patterns` on each pip group is what keeps a denylisted name out
of the group (it still gets its own, permanently-quarantined standalone PR -- see the inline
comment on that group and Decision 99's reversal-conditions stanza for the accepted cost and its
retirement criteria).

DERIVED, never enumerated (Decision 187 derive-don't-enumerate): the denylist is parsed out of the
shell script at check time, never re-listed as a literal in this module, so a future addition to
`_DENIED_DEPENDENCIES` fails this gate until `.github/dependabot.yml` catches up -- that lag is the
point, not a bug. A denylist that cannot be parsed FAILS LOUDLY: silently treating an unparseable
denylist as "nothing to exclude" would convert this into a check that asserts nothing while
reporting green.

Scoped to `package-ecosystem: pip` entries only: duckdb is a PyPI distribution, so asserting its
absence from (for example) the `github-actions` ecosystem's groups would be vacuous and would force
noise config into an entry that could never carry it. The assertion is scoped to pip groups AS A
WHOLE, not to groups whose `patterns:` could plausibly match a denied name -- a future pip group
narrowly patterned on something duckdb could never match (say `patterns: ["boto3*"]`) is still
required to carry `exclude-patterns` for every denied name under this scoping. That is the same
noise-config trap the ecosystem-level scoping exists to avoid; if such a group appears, revisit the
scoping rather than special-casing around it. Note `ducklake` is not a pip requirement anywhere in
this repo (no requirements file declares it -- it is a DuckDB extension, not a package), so its
exclusion from the pip group is inert defensive config Dependabot could never act on. It is carried
anyway because the derived assertion reads the denylist verbatim; that is the honest price of
deriving rather than enumerating, not evidence a ducklake pip bump is reachable.

Filesystem-only: no subprocess, no network, matching every sibling ci_guards module.

Decision 170 (MANDATORY declaration obligation): calls registry.examined() on every reachable exit
path -- this is a NEW check, so it cannot be grandfathered into
config/check_accounting_baseline.yaml (frozen _BASELINE_SEED; validate_check_accounting rejects an
undeclared new check outright).
