"""terraform-apply-sandbox.yml dispatch-gated-apply topology guard (Decision 183; rec-2918 part (c)).

rec-2918 identified a dispatch-vs-push deadlock: the workflow_dispatch acknowledge-and-retry path
(the ONLY heal verb that plans fresh at main HEAD) could hit a guard-ROUTED verdict (out-of-budget
IAM / trust / destroy) and have nowhere to go -- gated-apply's job-level `if` admitted a push event
only, so a routed dispatch's fresh plan was silently discarded and the red convergence record
stayed latched. Decision 183 makes gated-apply DISPATCH-REACHABLE: reachable from EITHER heal verb,
with the fresh plan.bin handed over as a run-scoped SANDBOX_FRESH_PLAN_ARTIFACT (mirrors
reconcile.yml's RECONCILE_FRESH_PLAN_ARTIFACT hand-off verbatim) instead of being fetched from S3.

Eight invariants, asserted over the PARSED workflow (never a whole-file grep, matching the sibling
scripts.verify_ci_workflow._check_recovery_workflow_topology shape this guard is modelled on):

  (i)   gated-apply's `if` contains the routed signal and NO LONGER contains the push conjunct --
        the exact pre-fix shape this guard exists to reject.
  (ii)  gated-apply still declares `environment: tf-gated-apply` (the sole authorization boundary,
        Decision 92) and its `apply` step applies plan.bin verbatim; no step in the job re-plans
        (Decision 77 no-TOCTOU -- a `terraform plan` smuggled into gated-apply would defeat the
        guard's inspection of the applied plan).
  (iii) apply-sandbox declares the three job outputs the hand-off depends on: fresh_plan_pending
        (derived from the EMIT step's outcome), fresh_plan_sha256, and artifact_sha.
  (iv)  the upload-artifact step and the sha256 EMIT step are gated on BOTH a workflow_dispatch
        event and a guard-routed verdict -- the fresh plan.bin must never upload on a push (it
        already has a saved plan in S3) or on an un-routed dispatch (nothing to hand off).
  (v)   gated-apply's download-artifact and sha256 VERIFY steps are gated on fresh_plan_pending;
        fetch_plan is gated on ITS NEGATION plus push -- the two plan sources stay mutually
        exclusive and a saved plan.bin is never fetched on a dispatch.
  (vi)  the artifact-sha chain survives the widened reach: gated-apply's artifact_sha step echoes
        needs.apply-sandbox.outputs.artifact_sha (it can no longer re-resolve a PR from a dispatch
        commit) and its DuckLake fetch step still reads steps.artifact_sha.outputs.value.
  (vii) both best-effort wake steps derive their PR-lookup SHA from the acknowledge input on a
        dispatch, so the wake targets the incident PR being watched, not an unrelated HEAD commit.
  (viii) apply-sandbox's own job `if` admits ONLY push and workflow_dispatch. This is the belt
        invariant (i) removed: with no event conjunct left on gated-apply, its exclusion from the
        workflow's pull_request trigger rests solely on apply-sandbox skipping (and thus failing
        gated-apply's `needs` condition). Widening that `if` would make the tf-gated-apply
        Environment PR-reachable with zero signal (Decision 83 / T2.22: NOT a PR required check).

Declares registry.examined(8, unit="topology_invariants") (Decision 170) -- one count per
invariant above, not per individual assertion within one. Loads the workflow via
scripts.verify_ci_workflow._load (never re-implements YAML parsing); registry.skipped(reason) only
if the workflow file itself cannot be read.

Own module because scripts/verify_ci_workflow.py sits at exactly 500 SLOC (Decision 128: never
raise without a marker; a new module beats a facade decomposition for one guard).

Filesystem-only: no subprocess, no network, matching every sibling ci_guards module.
