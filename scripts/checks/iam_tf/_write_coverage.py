"""Write-coverage submodule -- DISCOVERY-DRIVEN (design (a), PLAN-iam-write-surface-completion).

The enumerated-model recurrence (rec-2703 / rec-2757) was a resource whose refresh-READ was covered
but whose WRITE verb was missing from github_ci_apply's grant surface, so a real apply AccessDenied.
The read-coverage gate (_read_coverage) closes the read half; this submodule closes the write half.

WHY THIS MODULE WAS REWRITTEN (the ROOT CAUSE this plan exists to fix): the previous version
declared `APPLY_WRITTEN_TYPES = frozenset(WRITE_COVERAGE)` and then branched on
`rtype in APPLY_WRITTEN_TYPES and rtype not in WRITE_COVERAGE` -- UNSATISFIABLE by construction, so
the "an apply-role-written type with no write-coverage entry FAILS LOUD" claim in its docstring was
false. Its only test coverage reached that branch by monkeypatching the frozenset, which is proof
the production path was unreachable. Meanwhile WRITE_COVERAGE hand-listed 5 types against the 31
distinct resource types actually present in terraform/personal.

The write side is now discovery-driven, mirroring the read side:
  1. Every DISCOVERED terraform/personal resource type must be either WRITE_COVERAGE-mapped or
     WRITE_EXEMPT_TYPES-exempt (each exemption carrying its own one-line justification). A type that
     is neither FAILS LOUD -- this is the branch that used to be dead code.
  2. Every discovered WRITE_COVERAGE-mapped type's required write verbs must be granted on a
     Resource containing its marker. A removed / narrowed write grant fails the PR (DEP-01
     write-surface gap). Gating direction 2 on discovery is what makes the whole check
     discovery-driven: a type that has left terraform/personal stops being asserted, exactly as the
     read side behaves, and re-arms the moment a resource of that type reappears.

HONEST SCOPE LIMIT (recorded so nobody over-claims): design (a) alone would have caught NONE of the
three historical instances of the "headline verb granted, companion verb missing" class (rec-2831,
rec-2842, rec-2882) -- aws_iam_role was already WRITE_COVERAGE-mapped in all three. (a) closes the
"type never mapped at all" hole. The phase-keyed mandatory-declaration table in _write_companions
closes the "type mapped but its companion verbs were never enumerated" hole that actually recurred,
and _write_symmetry adds the two mechanical scope rules. Neither can enumerate a verb nobody knows
the provider calls -- only CloudTrail can, which is the filed class-closing follow-on.

Credential-free (pure text parsing) -- eligible for --pre and full tiers. Stays < 500 SLOC.
