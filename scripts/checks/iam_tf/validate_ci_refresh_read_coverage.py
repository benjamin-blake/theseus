"""CI refresh-read + write coverage gate (facade -- Decision 128 decomposition, Decision 144 / T2.48).

This module is a thin facade/orchestrator over two cohesive submodules (each < 500 SLOC, Decision 128
decompose-by-default, not raise):
  - _read_coverage: the READ classification maps + shared HCL parse/scan/match primitives + the
    per-resource read-coverage assertion (extracted byte-equivalent from the pre-decomposition module).
  - _write_coverage: the WRITE-coverage map (managed resource type -> required write verbs + prefix)
    + the assertion that github_ci_apply's inline policy write-covers every apply-role-written type
    (c5, DEP-01; closes the read-covered-but-write-missing recurrence rec-2703/rec-2757).

The registered check name (validate_ci_refresh_read_coverage) and its registry entry are UNCHANGED.
The private parse/resolve helpers are re-exported here so their existing branch-level tests (which
import them from this module path) keep passing unmodified.
