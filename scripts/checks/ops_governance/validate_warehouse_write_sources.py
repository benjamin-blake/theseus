    """Enforce the warehouse-as-source-of-truth invariant.

    Every call to OpsWriter().write("ops_*", ...) must originate from a
    whitelisted file. The whitelist captures the four legitimate write paths:
    1. Portal calls (file_rec/update_rec/file_decision/update_decision)
    2. Canonical ETL from a non-warehouse source of truth (DECISIONS.md -> ops_decisions)
    3. Outbox drain (write-once transient buffer, never replayable)
    4. Fresh in-memory writes (e.g. priority queue enrichment, execution plan save)

    Any new file that writes to an ops_* table must be reviewed against the
    warehouse-as-source invariant in CLAUDE.md before being added to the
    whitelist. Replaying a read cache (e.g. logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl) into
    the warehouse is the resurrection anti-pattern that creates infinite
    re-injection loops -- Iceberg DELETE removes the snapshot, the next replay
    re-injects, SCD2 dedupe surfaces the resurrection as the current row.
