"""Fallback re-evaluation carrier for CD.27's Lambda Durable Functions fallback (ESB-02
remediation, docs/plans/PLAN-esb-fallback-spec-carrier.yaml).

CD.27's maturity-monitoring discipline_point promised a re-evaluation trigger at each gated
atomic-plan filing; before this module, no carrier enforced it (ESB-02: a phantom control).
This check is the instantiated carrier: it resolves CD.27's OWN `gates` list from the roadmap
as the trigger set (single-sourced, drift-proof -- Decision 136 precedent), then requires any
NET-NEW docs/plans/PLAN-*.yaml naming a gated tier item -- via `closes_criteria` OR via the
required `phase` field -- to carry a `fallback_reevaluation` block (scripts/roadmap/
plan_document.py FallbackReevaluation).

NET-NEW SCOPING (Decision 132's settled answer to retro-fitting): only plans added
(git status "A") since the origin/main merge-base are in scope. A whole-directory version of
this predicate reddens 8 historical plans (verified at authoring time) that legitimately touch
CD.27-gated tier items without ever having formed a substrate verdict -- retro-fitting them
would be exactly the kind of after-the-fact assertion ESB-02 exists to remove. A net-new-but-
UNCOMMITTED plan surfaces as git status "??", not "A", and is therefore NOT in scope until
committed.

PHASE-LEG INSTANTIABILITY: a closes_criteria-only trigger is UNINSTANTIABLE for T4.1 and T4.4
today -- their exit_criteria are bare strings (13 and 6 criteria respectively), so
validate_platform_roadmap check (iii) cannot resolve a `"T4.1:c1"`-shaped ref against them, and
one live guard pins T4.1 criteria bare (tests/esb_text_fix/test_workspace_store_criteria.py::
test_t41_exit_criteria_remain_bare_strings). T4.2 alone converted to ledger form
(PLAN-executor-substrate-guard-deferral), so a `"T4.2:c1"`-shaped ref is now resolvable there.
The phase leg is therefore what still makes this carrier reachable for T4.1/T4.4-gated plans
until a further T4.x plan converts them to ledger form.

BOUNDARY-AWARE TOKEN MATCH IS MANDATORY on the phase leg -- gate `T4.1` is a string PREFIX of
six live tier_item ids (T4.10, T4.10a, T4.11, T4.12, T4.13, T4.14). A bare substring match would
compel a future T4.13 plan to record a substrate verdict it has no basis to form -- doc-says-X /
control-does-Y, reproduced INSIDE the control this wave built to remove that defect. The pattern
is `(?<![\\w.])<gate>(?![\\w])`: the lookahead excludes word characters ONLY (not `.`), so a
legitimate sentence-final "T4.4." still matches while "T4.12"/"T4.13" do not match gate "T4.1".
The closes_criteria leg needs no such matcher: its item ids are already discrete tokens (split
on ':', index 0 -- Decision 136: existence is validate_platform_roadmap check (iii)'s job, not
re-validated here), so exact set membership suffices.

THREE MECHANICS THIS PRIMITIVE DOES NOT SHARE with the validate_graduation_completeness /
validate_verifier_same_pr_guard `_added_plan_paths` precedent, all load-bearing:
  (a) this module takes NO `root` argument and hard-keys on module-level `_common.ROOT` (Decision
      104 discipline: shared primitives referenced via the qualified `_common.<name>` form).
  (b) net-new derivation is `_common.get_status_aware_diff()`'s "A" entries, which diffs against
      the MERGE-BASE with origin/main (not origin/main directly) -- not a drop-in equivalent of
      the `_added_plan_paths` precedent's `git diff --diff-filter=A origin/main`.
  (c) `_common.get_status_aware_diff()` SILENTLY FALLS BACK TO comparing against HEAD when the
      merge-base lookup fails, rather than raising -- an unreachable origin/main would otherwise
      make this check pass VACUOUSLY (no net-new plans found) instead of admitting it could not
      determine the diff. This is exactly what makes the `_common.origin_main_reachable()` guard
      below load-bearing rather than decorative: it must run BEFORE the diff, as an explicit
      advisory-SKIP, not be inferred from an empty diff result.

Fail-loud (Decision 55) if CD.27 is absent from the roadmap -- a missing trigger set is not
"nothing to check". Advisory-SKIP (never a failure) when origin/main is unreachable (Decision 132
limitation A) -- structurally identical to validate_graduation_completeness's own advisory-SKIP
for the same condition.

Injectable seam: `roadmap_path` ONLY. There is deliberately no `plans_dir` seam and no
`added_paths` seam. `_common.ROOT` is the SOLE root for everything net-new-plan-related (the
diff itself, and resolving each added path back to a file to load) -- a second, independent
root parameter here would be two ways to be wrong instead of one: a caller could patch
`_common.ROOT` (which the real-git tests do) while a stale `plans_dir` default silently pointed
elsewhere, and nothing would catch the mismatch. Tests that need to prove the net-new predicate
against real git state patch `scripts.checks._common.ROOT` and lay out the fixture tree there --
see tests/checks/roadmap/test_validate_fallback_reevaluation.py. NO `added_paths` injection seam
either: validate_graduation_completeness's own docstring (:34-38) refuses that seam because "a
seam would defeat the point of the test": the net-new predicate must be proven against REAL git
state (a throwaway repo with a real refs/remotes/origin/main), not an injected stub, because
this plan's entire retro-fit defence rests on that property actually holding.

CARRIER LIFECYCLE -- CANONICAL HERE (code review round 3 / High): this module docstring is the
enforcement-collocated site (AGENTS.md: "collocate semantic definitions with their enforcement
counterparts in a single file"), so the full lifecycle lives ONLY here. CD.27's own
`fallback_spec.reevaluation_carrier` text and the plan's CARRIER LIFECYCLE context entry each
carry a one-line POINTER to this paragraph, never a restatement -- a second or third verbatim
copy with nothing enforcing sync would be a NEW unenforced claim minted inside the very
remediation ESB-02 exists to close.
  - PERSISTENCE: the carrier PERSISTS against a ratified CD. All ratified CDs retain their
    candidate_decisions entry and `gates` list, so the CD.27-sourced trigger set survives
    ratification unchanged -- this is correct rather than incidental, because CD.27 scopes the
    maturity hedge to the first 12 months AFTER ratification, so the obligation's live window
    BEGINS at ratification and the check is a no-op in practice before it.
  - EXIT: in-band, via the `obligation_lapsed` FallbackVerdict recorded on a plan's
    `fallback_reevaluation` block (basis: the ratification date, or whatever event closed the
    obligation). The carrier requires A recorded verdict, never a particular one -- it retires by
    leaving an audit trail, never by someone remembering to delete a check, which is the exact
    failure that would make it a cousin of the phantom control it replaces.
  - DISCLOSED RESIDUALS (all three, not a partial list -- each is an honest floor of a text-keyed
    trigger, accepted rather than papered over):
      (i) a plan MODIFIED rather than added escapes the net-new-scoping leg (Decision 132's own
          disclosed limitation, inherited knowingly here).
      (ii) an unreachable origin/main advisory-SKIPs the whole check rather than failing (Decision
           132 limitation A) -- see the origin_main_reachable() discussion above.
      (iii) a T4.x plan naming no gated item in either `phase` or `closes_criteria` escapes
            entirely -- the carrier has no third leg to catch it.
