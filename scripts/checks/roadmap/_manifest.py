"""Entry literals for the roadmap domain's registered checks (Decision 169, amends Decision 104).

Bare string-literal module=/attr= pairs only -- see docs/contracts/check-manifest.yaml. Aggregated
by scripts/checks/registry.py; never imported by scripts/validate.py directly.

Every gated Entry's pre_globs must cover the check's whole transitive first-party import closure.
Two consequences visible below: (1) scripts/roadmap/platform_roadmap.py is a pure Decision-124
facade -- the Pydantic models, the state machine and the gate-rule grammar live one level up in
scripts/platform_roadmap_{models,state,gate_rules}.py, so "scripts/roadmap/**" alone does NOT
reach the schemas these checks validate against; (2) every gated Entry carries
scripts/checks/_common.py and scripts/checks/registry.py, which every check imports at module
scope and calls at run time (_common.ROOT / diff helpers, registry.examined()/skipped()). The
rest of the scripts/checks/ spine (_schema.py, sibling domains' _manifest.py, the package
__init__) is deliberately NOT globbed: a break there fails registry -> scripts/validate.py at
IMPORT time, so the whole --pre run crashes red before any gate is consulted.
