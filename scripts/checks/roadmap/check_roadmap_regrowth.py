"""Roadmap compaction regrowth observable -- REPORT-ONLY (Decision 147 point 4, rec-2781).

Decision 147 compacted docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml from 9,996 to 7,329 lines and made a durable
norm of it: ratified/superseded `candidate_decisions` and complete/reserved `tier_items` are
stored compact, their narrative living in DECISIONS.md (Decision 86) or in git history. Point 4
of that Decision asks for a mechanical anti-regrowth observable so the compaction does not
silently erode on the next edit to a terminal item. This is that observable.

REPORT-ONLY IS ABSOLUTE. `failed` is never appended to on ANY path, the roadmap is never
written, and the presubmit exit code is identical with and without this check on every input --
which also means it NEVER RAISES: scripts/checks/validation_result.py's dispatch_recording runs
a check inside registry.outcome_scope with NO try/except, so an escaping exception would abort
the whole tier run and destroy that run's CI-RCA attribution substrate.

WHAT IS REPORTED. One growth line in a fixed grammar (`GROWTH lines= baseline= growth= headroom=
escalate= threshold=`), whose `escalate` field reads true once headroom to the Decision 114
ceiling falls below _ESCALATE_HEADROOM_LINES -- the named trip threshold Decision 147's reversal
condition needs a number for, printed unconditionally and never failing. Then the terminal
content that has re-accumulated: ratified/superseded candidate_decisions carrying more than the
single compact line Decision 147 point 1 retains (CD.7's "fully superseded by CD.28" marker,
which validate_candidate_decision_supersession reads as a literal phrase, is exactly that one
allowed line), and complete/reserved tier_items carrying progress_note/note/decomposition_hints,
multi-line intent, or a non-empty files_in_scope. Then one MALFORMED-STATE line counting the
records whose `state`/`status` is not a string at all -- zero on the live document, and printed
unconditionally so a shape no terminal branch can speak for is surfaced rather than dropped.

DECLARATION (Decision 170 arm (a), which the frozen `_BASELINE_SEED` in
scripts/checks/hygiene/validate_check_accounting.py offers this check no grandfather path out
of: report-only status is not an exemption). Every reachable exit declares --
examined(n, unit="terminal_records") on the normal exit, and ONE skipped(reason) exit that every
unusable-input shape routes to with `failed` left untouched: OSError (an absent or unreadable
roadmap), UnicodeDecodeError (undecodable bytes), yaml.YAMLError (malformed YAML -- a LIVE
fast-tier input, since the Entry's pre_globs gate this check on docs/ROADMAP-*), a non-mapping
document, a non-list `tier_items` or `candidate_decisions`, and a `tier_items` or
`candidate_decisions` list whose ENTRIES are not mappings. That last shape is enumerated
deliberately: it is a list, so a non-list guard passes it through, and an unguarded
`raw_item.get()` on an int, a str or None then raises AttributeError. validate_platform_roadmap
is not exposed to it because it reaches its raw-item loop only after a successful Pydantic load;
this check does its own bare yaml.safe_load with no schema, so it is. Only named exception
classes are caught and there is no bare except anywhere in this module --
scripts/checks/hygiene/validate_declaring_coverage.py is the precedent followed literally.

TOTALITY OVER THE ENTRY SHAPE, not over an enumerated list of them. A mapping entry whose
`status`/`state` value is itself a YAML list or mapping is a SECOND, disjoint hazard from the
non-mapping entry above: the entry passes every shape gate, and a bare
`entry.get("status") in <frozenset>` then raises TypeError on the unhashable value. Every read of
those two fields therefore goes through `_state_of`, which yields the value only when it is a
string; any other shape is neither terminal nor non-terminal, is counted on the MALFORMED-STATE
line and reaches no membership test at all. The shapes this module is total over are the ones
the mirror test's matrix drives (TestUnavailableRoadmapSkips and
TestNonStringStateIsCountedNotRaised), not a list frozen in prose.
