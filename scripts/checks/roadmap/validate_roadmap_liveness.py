"""Roadmap blocking-graph liveness ratchet (PLAN-roadmap-blocking-liveness-detector; rec-3395,
rec-3394; docs/contracts/roadmap-liveness.yaml).

Three heterogeneous legs sharing one registered check and one RoadmapDocument load (governance
rationale: docs/contracts/roadmap-liveness.yaml's `governance_note`):

  Leg A -- toxic-SCC shrink-only ratchet against config/roadmap_liveness_baseline.yaml, mirroring
  scripts/checks/hygiene/validate_check_accounting.py's (a)/(b)/(c) structure, plus a fourth
  sub-leg (d) that gives the ratchet teeth in the shrinking direction too.
  Leg B -- every 'rehomed' exit criterion's met_by target must carry at least one open criterion.
  Leg C -- diff-scoped: an added/changed criterion naming a NON_TERMINAL id with a blocking
  phrase (docs/contracts/roadmap-liveness.yaml's sole-source grammar) must carry a matching
  blocked_by entry.

All three legs hard-fail -- there is no warn tier (docs/contracts/check-accounting.yaml's
status_vocabulary has no "warned" member; a warn here would record as "enforced").
