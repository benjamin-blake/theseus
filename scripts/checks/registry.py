"""Ordered per-tier check registry (Decision 104, dispatch rewired to per-domain manifests by
Decision 169, amending Decision 104's facade re-export mechanism).

``register()`` tags a validate_*/check_* function with its owner metadata -- UNCHANGED, and still
the sole identity/ownership oracle (97 sites, orphan-detection AST walk target). Dispatch and
tier-sequence derivation now come from the 18 per-domain scripts/checks/<domain>/_manifest.py
``Entry`` manifests (grammar: docs/contracts/check-manifest.yaml), never from a facade re-export
block in scripts/validate.py.

Registering a new check touches SEVEN surfaces, not merely this package (retracts the earlier
"touches ONLY this package" claim -- three of the seven sit outside scripts/checks entirely; plan-
obligation-closure / docs/contracts/plan-obligations.yaml): (1) the check module under
scripts/checks/<domain>/; (2) its ``@register(...)`` decoration; (3) an ``Entry`` literal (bare
string-literal module=/attr=) in that domain's ``_manifest.py``; (4) a
config/ci_rca_taxonomy.yaml ``function_to_category`` row; (5) a
config/agent/verification_registry/entries/<check_id>.yaml shard per GRADUATED verification_plan
step (not per check); (6) the mirror test at tests/<mirrored>/test_<module>.py; (7) an ``examined()``/
``skipped()`` declaration on every reachable exit path of the check body itself (Decision 170,
docs/contracts/check-accounting.yaml) -- the accounting channel below, so the check's own run
evidence distinguishes a vacuous pass, a skip and an enforced pass instead of collapsing all
three into "not failed". scripts/validate.py itself is still never touched. scripts/CLAUDE.md
points at this enumeration; it does not restate it.

Accounting channel (Decision 170). A registered check's body -- or a non-check scaffold wrapped
in ``outcome_scope`` -- declares what it examined via ``examined(count, unit=)`` or that it
skipped via ``skipped(reason)``. The declaration is held in a per-dispatch SLOT (module-level,
reset on each ``outcome_scope`` entry -- dispatch is sequential, never concurrent, so this is not
reentrant by design) and is harvested by the caller immediately after the scope exits via
``pop_declaration()``. ``derive_status()``/``build_outcome()`` are the SOLE place the five
outcome states (failed/skipped/vacuous/enforced/undeclared) are computed, so they can never drift
apart: an append to ``failed`` always yields "failed" regardless of what was declared; absent
that, a ``skipped(reason)`` declaration yields "skipped", an ``examined(0)`` declaration yields
"vacuous", an ``examined(n>0)`` declaration yields "enforced", and no declaration at all yields
"undeclared". The ROW ACCUMULATOR this feeds (one ``CheckOutcome`` per dispatched check/scaffold)
lives in ``scripts.checks.validation_result`` -- not here -- because it resets per RUN via that
module's own ``clear()``, mirroring the existing ``_ATTRIBUTIONS`` contract.

``resolve(name)`` imports the Entry's defining module and returns ``getattr(module, entry.attr)``
at CALL TIME. The module import may be cached (importlib's own sys.modules cache); the RESOLVED
CALLABLE is NEVER cached, so a test's ``patch("<defining module>.<attr>", ...)`` still intercepts
through a real dispatch pass. ``all_checks()`` imports every manifest-declared module (populating
``_REGISTRY`` via each module's own ``@register`` decorator) before returning the registry -- the
ONLY place this package imports check modules; doing so at THIS module's own import time would be
a genuine circular import, since every check module does ``from scripts.checks import registry``.

Tier dispatch (scripts/validate.py) iterates ``pre_sequence()``/``full_sequence()``; each "check"
step is resolved via ``resolve(name)(failed)`` and each "scaffold" step is resolved against a dict
of closures built locally in main() (they close over per-run locals a generic registry cannot own).
