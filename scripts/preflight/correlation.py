"""Rec/commit correlation concern for session_preflight.

correlate_recs_with_commits carries the Decision 43 CC waiver (31 branches): a single
per-rec classification pass over commits with several independent short-circuit signals
(id-mention, file-path match, closed-sibling cluster) -- this is the same waiver the
pre-decomposition scripts/session/preflight.py carried at file top for this function.

    General engine for all rec sources (generalised from the ci_rca path, T3.8).

    A rec is LIKELY-RESOLVED when any commit on origin/main whose date is

    still uncorrelated after the commit loop is also classified LIKELY-RESOLVED

    title and was closed at/after this rec's creation (window-independent
    closed-sibling cluster signal). The matched sibling id is recorded on the
    rec as ``_resolved_reason`` for the operator's verify-and-close prompt.
