"""
Purge known orphan rows from ops_recommendations and assert post-purge state.

Root cause analysis (RCA):
- PR #304 deleted local S3 outbox files for rec-608 and rec-633. Those rows had
  already been drained to Athena before the plan ran, so no Athena DML was ever
  issued. The PR only removed the local outbox artefact, not the warehouse row.
- PLAN-dq-write-enforcement-unification VP Step 7 prescribed an inline DELETE
  one-liner for id IS NULL; the implementation commit (b6ba53b) contains no
  evidence it was executed. The ghost row (id=NULL) persists in the warehouse.
- Root cause class: Class E -- post-deploy cleanup step not executed or not
  asserted. Root cause taxonomy lives in the DQ-manifest YAMLs
  (config/agent/data_quality/decisions/{table}.yaml), Decision 65.

This script closes the gap by treating DELETE + assertion as one atomic unit,
preventing a recurrence where cleanup appears complete but the warehouse row
persists.
