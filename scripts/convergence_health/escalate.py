"""Convergence-stale idempotent escalation (CD.35 Wave 6 / T2.35).

Provides an idempotent escalation path: files OR updates a single
tf_convergence_stale rec per red-episode via scripts.ops_data_portal
(file_rec / update_rec). Never writes the convergence record; never runs
terraform apply; never dispatches terraform-apply-sandbox. Part of the
scripts.convergence_health package -- see scripts/convergence_health/__init__.py
for the full public surface.

The file/update/close orchestration below is scripts.rec_episode.run_episode (rec-3291 /
rec-3563): this module used to bulk-fetch every open rec via the `open_recs` named verb and
filter the result on `source`/`status` -- two columns that verb never projects, so the filter
always matched nothing and every red episode re-filed a duplicate rec instead of updating the one
already open. run_episode's find_rec does a source-scoped structural read instead, and raises
rather than silently returning None if a row is ever missing a key this lookup filters on.
