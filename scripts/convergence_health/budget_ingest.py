"""CI fast-tier budget-block warehouse ingester (rec-3288 / D2-2b).

PR #968 put a machine-readable `budget` block into the selection manifest that ci.yml's
`pr-validate` job already uploads as the `selection-manifest` artifact on every run
(`if: always()`). Nothing read it. The `pr-validate` job is deliberately credential-free (it also
runs on fork PRs), so scripts/checks/_budget_recs.py's CI branch skips the portal write and only
mirrors the diagnostic to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`; and ci-rca.yml's own manifest fetch is gated on
`head_branch == default_branch`. The residual that leaves: a fast-tier breach REDS pr-validate
(scripts/validate.py exits 1 immediately after recording the outcome, so the breaching run cannot
merge green), but the credential-free job cannot file the warehouse rec -- so the CI breach
population is invisible to the warehouse, and a breach on a PR head that is later fixed and merged
leaves no warehouse trace at all.

This module closes that gap from the convergence-health cron, which already carries the
credentials both legs need (`agent-platform-github-ci-branch` -> ducklake reader + writer) and
already runs the established alarm-only, one-rec-per-episode sensor pattern
(`tf_convergence_stale`, `ducklake_code_drift`, `prod_code_drift`).

EPISODE GRAIN and DEDUPE. One rec per `(branch, dominant_phase)` -- the exact key
`scripts.checks._budget_recs._find_open_budget_breach_rec` matches on, via the exact context
markers (`"Branch: {branch}."` / `"Dominant phase: {phase}."`) the local filing path writes. That
function is IMPORTED, never re-implemented: if the two ever disagreed, a locally-filed rec and an
ingested one would coexist for the same episode. Every ingested rec therefore carries
`source="budget_breach"` regardless of which breach-class outcome produced it (the outcome set is
recorded in the title and context instead) -- a second source value would be invisible to that
matcher and would double-file.

A RESOLVED REC IS NEVER RESURRECTED. The trigger here is an IMMUTABLE artifact inside its 14-day
retention window, not a live condition, so closing the rec does not remove the trigger: an
open-recs-only dedupe re-files a human-closed rec on the very next hourly tick, and keeps doing so
for up to 14 days. This module therefore consults recs in ANY status, taking the status-aware shape
scripts/ci_rca/dedup.py already established ("a CLOSED head is never bumped" -- a closed-head match
routes to drop, never to a bump or a reopen). MECHANISM, chosen as the simplest one the reachable
reader verbs support: `open_recs` cannot serve this at all (it filters `status = 'open'`
server-side), so `recs_by_title_prefix` -- any status, bound to `Fast-tier budget%on {branch}` --
narrows to that branch's budget recs, and `rec_by_id` then pulls each RESOLVED candidate's full row
so the SAME two (branch, dominant_phase) markers can be matched against its context. An episode
matching a resolved rec is DROPPED: no file, no update, no reopen (Decision 103 forbids the silent
reactivation regardless).

NO-OP UPDATES ARE SKIPPED. The update leg fires only when the computed title or context actually
differs from what the open rec already stores. Without that guard an unchanged episode writes one
identical SCD2 history row per hourly tick -- ~336 over an artifact's retention, times every
concurrently-open episode.

FILE/UPDATE ONLY, NEVER CLOSE. Unlike the drift sensors this one has no close leg: `budget_breach`
recs are also filed by the LOCAL validate path, and an episode ageing out of the artifact-retention
window (14 days) is not evidence its rec is resolved. Auto-closing on absence would silently close
locally-filed recs.

FAIL LOUDLY, NO OUTBOX (Decision 84 I-4). A portal write that cannot complete raises at the call
site -- nothing is buffered or staged for replay, and the next hourly tick re-derives the whole
population from the artifact window. A dead GitHub query likewise raises rather than reporting an
empty (and therefore reassuring) population -- Decision 55 anti-masking, the same posture
code_drift._assert_full_history takes against a shallow clone.

Every external dependency -- the GitHub API caller, the artifact fetcher, both rec lists (open and
resolved), the ops portal -- is injected, so the whole module is unit-testable with no network. Part of the
scripts.convergence_health package -- see scripts/convergence_health/__init__.py for the full
public surface.

        gh_caller:        Injected callable(url) -> parsed JSON, mirroring approvals.py. When None,
                          built from GH_TOKEN/GITHUB_TOKEN.
        artifact_fetcher: Injected callable(archive_download_url) -> zip bytes. When None, built
                          from the same token.
        portal_caller:    Injected callable(action, fields) for testability, mirroring escalate().
                          When None, uses scripts.ops_data_portal.file_rec / update_rec directly.
        open_recs:        Pre-fetched open rec list (for testing). When None, fetched live via the
                          DuckLake reader `open_recs` named verb -- never the JSONL read cache.
                          Fetched ONLY when there is at least one episode to file against.
        resolved_recs:    Pre-fetched resolved (closed/declined/superseded) budget_breach recs (for
                          testing). When None, fetched live per branch via _fetch_resolved_budget_recs,
                          and ONLY for an episode with no open match -- see the module docstring's
                          resurrection section.
        owner/repo:       Repository whose artifacts are swept.
        per_page:         Artifacts listing page size.
        profile:          AWS profile for the reader / portal.
        dry_run:          Report what would be filed or updated and touch neither the portal nor
                          anything else. What operators and tests use; the workflow does not.
