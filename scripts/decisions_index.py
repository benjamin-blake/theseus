"""Generated decisions index (audit finding DCG-08, PLAN-dcg-decisions-index, FINAL wave of
the dcg-* audit-consolidation series; PLAN-decision-scout-bounded-retrieval adds `live`, the
triage_excerpt fields, and `category_tags`).

A lightweight, machine-parseable projection over BOTH docs/DECISIONS.md and
docs/DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md -- number, title, status, decided_date, typed
supersedes/superseded_by/amends edges, a `live` provenance flag, and a bounded triage excerpt --
derived SOLELY via the shared parser scripts.decisions_md (DAF-03 single-parser rule): no second
header/title regex lives here.

build_index() projects ONLY stable fields from each parse_decisions_md() row -- it EXCLUDES the
parser's volatile created_timestamp/last_updated_timestamp/content_hash/raw_block fields, so two
consecutive calls are byte-identical (json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True) equal) and the committed
docs/decisions-index.json can be compared for drift without a timestamp always tripping it.

Edge derivation:
  - amends: the row's own "amends" key -- envelope-sourced (scripts.decisions_md
    extract_entry_envelope's `amends` field) when the entry carries a well-formed metadata
    envelope, else the legacy title-relation extraction (extract_amends_edges). No second
    derivation lives here: this generator consumes whichever value parse_decisions_md() already
    resolved, unchanged (PLAN-decision-entry-flow-governance, Decision 167).
  - superseded_by: the row's typed "superseded_by" string ('dec-NNN' or ''), coerced to
    int | None.
  - supersedes: the corpus-wide UNION of (a) the inverse of every OTHER row's superseded_by
    pointing at this number, and (b) this row's own "title_supersedes" key -- likewise
    envelope-sourced (the envelope's `supersedes` field) when present, else the legacy
    title-borne extraction (scripts.decisions_md._extract_title_borne_supersedes).

`significance` is a parse_decisions_md() row key (the envelope's routing claim dict, or {} when
absent) that is DELIBERATELY NOT projected into docs/decisions-index.json -- it is parser-surfaced
and check-read only (scripts.checks.decisions.validate_decision_entry_conformance), mirroring the
index-only treatment of `intent`/`amends`/`title_supersedes` before them: the docs/decisions-index.json
byte pin (112,000 bytes as of migration step 5 of audits/contract-first-governance-33c8667.yaml,
re-derived downward from Decision 166 point 9's original 131,000 per that point's rec-3012
deferral and reversal condition (g); see tests/test_decisions_index.py for the derivation) grows
with every projected field on every row, and significance is a per-entry authoring-time claim the
index's consumers (decision-scout triage) have no use for.

`live` derivation (PLAN-decision-scout-bounded-retrieval): whether the decision number is headed
in docs/DECISIONS.md, via scripts.decisions_md.decision_header_numbers(paths=[docs/DECISIONS.md])
-- never a second parse of by_number's cross-file dict, which is last-occurrence-wins across the
two files (overlap is zero today, so this is latent, not live behaviour).

`currency` derivation (PLAN-decision-corpus-currency, rec-3055/rec-3056): a `currency` key is
projected onto every live:true row (never a live:false row) via
scripts.decisions_md.derive_currency, fed the corpus-wide inbound-supersedes and inbound-amends
sets built ONCE per build_index() call from this generator's own supersedes_map / per-row amends
projections -- never recomputed per row. This generator never validates the derived value against
docs/contracts/decision-entry.yaml's vocabulary; that is scripts.checks.decisions.
validate_decision_currency's job (invariant I3), so check_index_freshness keeps failing cleanly on
drift instead of this module surfacing an uncaught traceback on an unexpected value. `currency`
was already the narrowest of the five retrieval-aid keys; as of migration step 5 the other four
(below) share its live-only scope, for the same reason (see next paragraph).

`triage_excerpt` derivation, LIVE ROWS ONLY as of migration step 5 of
audits/contract-first-governance-33c8667.yaml (decision-scout never reads it for an archived row,
and the docs/decisions-index.json byte pin grows with every projected field on every row -- the
same rationale this docstring already gives above for excluding `significance`): a <=320-char
excerpt for the decision-scout bounded-retrieval SPIRIT lane (Decision 152 gate (ii) widened to
admit a Decision-clause quote), fallback order Intent -> Problem -> Context (the parser's
Rationale/Key details/Context extraction) -> Decision (the decision-body marker).
`triage_excerpt_source` names which of the four supplied the excerpt (or "" when none of the four
markers are present at all). `triage_excerpt_truncated` is True iff the source text exceeded 320
chars and was cut.

`category_tags` derivation, LIVE ROWS ONLY (same migration-step-5 scope and rationale as
`triage_excerpt` above): a sorted list of deterministic artifact/process-category tags (see
_CATEGORY_TAG_PATTERNS) matched against title + triage_excerpt only. Closes a recall gap the
excerpt alone left in decision-scout's bounded index-pass triage -- a decision that governs by
ARTIFACT TYPE (e.g. any new Lambda) rather than shared vocabulary was being silently discarded
before a targeted read; the scout now derives the proposed approach's own tag set once and
shortlists by mechanical set-intersection instead of a per-entry judgment call over the whole
index. Generator-internal and revisable without Decision ceremony -- a retrieval aid, not a
governance taxonomy.

check_index_freshness(failed) fails on DRIFT (committed != regenerated) OR ABSENCE -- unlike
scripts.dependency_graph.check_export_freshness (Decision 80 lean posture: no-op when the export
is absent), this index is a required committed artifact (Step 6b fork 2: committed JSON +
registered drift check, not a gitignored synced cache), so a missing file is itself a failure.

CLI: --write (regenerate docs/decisions-index.json), --check (freshness, exit 1 on fail),
--print (dump the current index to stdout).
