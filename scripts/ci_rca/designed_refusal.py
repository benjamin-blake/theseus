"""Designed-refusal fail-closed skip predicate for ci-rca.yml (PLAN-ci-rca-ops-plane-coverage).

Some watched workflows can fail via a DESIGNED refusal -- a gate that deliberately blocks a step
under a known, self-documenting condition (e.g. deploy-ducklake-lambdas' reconcile-gate job, the
Decision 88 reconcile-pending predicate) rather than a genuine defect. Filing a fresh
priority=critical ci_rca rec for every such refusal would mint a rec storm and a planning-queue
wedge (Decision 73 L5/L6) for a condition that already self-documents and already blocks the
deploy -- see PLAN-ci-rca-ops-plane-coverage's WATCHED-SET ADJUDICATION context, and rec-2854 for
the alarm-not-gate monitor lane that covers the STANDING refusal instead.

Fail-closed is the point (Decision 55): this predicate returns skip=true ONLY when the resolved
failing-job set for the run is non-empty AND every member is a DECLARED designed-refusal job for
that workflow slug. Any uncertainty -- an empty failing-job set, an unparseable/`{}` jobs file, or
any undeclared failing job (even alongside a declared one) -- returns skip=false, so the ci-rca
agent still runs and files.

Mirrors scripts/ci_rca/convergence_dedup.py exactly: a thin invocation-only shell, no network call
of its own -- it consumes the /tmp/ci-rca-jobs.json the existing "Fetch jobs JSON" step already
writes (continue-on-error, `{}` on failure -- a concrete producer for the fail-closed input).

CLI usage (invoked by ci-rca.yml's designed-refusal skip step):
    bin/venv-python -m scripts.ci_rca.designed_refusal \\
        --jobs-json /tmp/ci-rca-jobs.json --workflow-slug deploy-ducklake-lambdas
Prints skip=true|false.
