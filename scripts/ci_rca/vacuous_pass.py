"""Deterministic gate-escape evidence: vacuous-pass detection and merged-diff analysis.

Provides three evidence fields for the evidence bundle (schema_version 2):
  - vacuous_pass (True / False / "undetermined"): did the --pre picked-pytest step
    collect 0 items because --picked selected nothing (the defect) vs. because
    -m 'not integration' deselected an all-integration file (expected)?
  - merge_gate_test_coverage ("selected" / "not_selected" / "undetermined"): did the
    merged diff include a test file matching the --pre changed-tests selector?
  - coverage_regression (True / False / "undetermined"): were any test files deleted?

All computations are self-contained (gh-free), working from the pre-fetched CI log and
the local git checkout. HEAD^ must exist (fetch-depth: 2 in ci-rca.yml).

         "check_ran_vacuously" (test selected, collected 0 items) -- outranks rule 2 even when
         gate_is_postmerge_canary is also True.
      2. If gate_is_postmerge_canary is True -> "tier_misplaced" (caught only post-merge),
         regardless of whether vacuous_pass or merge_gate_test_coverage is the undetermined
         sentinel -- a canary run is a determinate fact independent of those two inputs.
      3. If workflow_tier_raw == "not_a_gate" -> "no_premerge_gate_by_design", without consulting
         merge_gate_test_coverage -- the workflow was never a gate at all.
      4. If vacuous_pass or merge_gate_test_coverage is "undetermined" -> "undetermined" (abstain).
         Narrowed to these two inputs only: gate_is_postmerge_canary's undetermined case is fully
         handled by rules 2-3 above running first (canary=True wins immediately; canary=anything
         with workflow_tier_raw='not_a_gate' also wins immediately), so this guard need not (and
         must not) re-test canary.

         "no_premerge_gate_by_design" (the retained c11 proxy). DEFENSIVE DEAD CODE on the live
         taxonomy: reachable only on a taxonomy miss (20 of 22 watched workflows are not_a_gate,
         caught by rule 3; the other 2 are tier CI, caught by rule 2), kept as the honest branch
         if the taxonomy ever gains a non-CI real tier. The `gate_is_postmerge_canary is False`
         precondition is REQUIRED even though this rule's body never references the canary: rule
         2 outranks this rule, so by the time we reach here an undetermined canary has NOT been
         proven false -- answering no_premerge_gate_by_design would be a guess.
