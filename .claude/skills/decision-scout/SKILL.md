description: "Use when: scope a proposed plan against active decisions, surface decision-contradiction flags before plan commitment, find related decisions a plan should cite. Mandatory pre-confirmation gate in /plan; runs in a fresh-context subagent so the bounded triage load stays off the planning agent."
---

## Intent

Given a proposed plan approach, surface every active decision that is relevant -- as context to cite, as a literal contradiction to resolve, as a related-work pointer, or as a spirit-alignment concern (the SPIRIT overlay, Phase 2). Triage is BOUNDED (Phase 1 step 1): the committed `docs/decisions-index.json` projection plus targeted reads of only shortlisted entries -- the corpus never loads wholesale into this subagent's context, let alone the parent's; only the structured summary returns.

This is a BLOCKING gate before `/plan` Step 6 "Present Findings and Confirm". A superficial scan that misses a contradiction is worse than not running -- the parent agent and human both trust this output to be exhaustive.

### Why a subagent, and why bounded

A naive inline grep from the planning agent misses implicit contradictions (different vocabulary, same concept) and would force it to load the corpus to judge. Bounded retrieval keeps that judgement in the subagent without the whole-corpus cost: triage every live title + `triage_excerpt` from the index, then read ONLY shortlisted entries as targeted source-file sections.

### Lambda / portal migration contract (T1.5 c1 owns this; rec-2774)

The index-plus-targeted-reads mechanism (Decision 160) is the INTERIM arrangement, not the T1.5 portal cutover (Decision 134 clause 5). T1.5 c1 owns swapping Phase 1 step 1's two reads for a queried tool call; the output contract, buckets, severity taxonomy, and quality gates below are the stable interface across that swap.

## Steps

### Phase 1: Load Inputs (MANDATORY)

1. **Triage source.** Read `docs/decisions-index.json` -- committed, generated solely from `docs/DECISIONS.md` and `docs/DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md` by `scripts.decisions_index`; used instead of the gitignored `ops_decisions` cache because CI PR roles lack reader access there and this gate stays credential-free and hermetic (Decision 105's R1-R3 guard relies on the same file-header hermeticity). Derive **M** = count of `live: true` entries -- the live-file header count, excluding the archive and distinct from the max decision number (numbering gaps). Each live entry's `title`, `triage_excerpt` (<=320 chars, Intent/Problem/Context/Decision fallback order; `triage_excerpt_source` names which; a small terse-historical band carries none), `currency`, and `category_tags` (deterministic artifact/process tags, e.g. `lambda`/`terraform`/`iam`/`secrets`/`deploy`/`egress`) is the Phase 2 signal -- never a whole-file load here.

2. Read the caller's input brief, which is mandated to include:
   - **Intent** (1-2 sentences from `/plan` Step 3 clarification)
   - **Proposed approach** (paragraph from `/plan` Step 3-5 synthesis)
   - **Scope file list** (from `/plan` Step 4 Identify Affected Files)
   - **Verification Tier** (V1 / V2 / V3, from `/plan` Step 5)
   - **Explicitly cited decision IDs** (any decisions the human or planning agent has already referenced)

If any of these inputs are absent in the prompt, return immediately with `Verdict: BLOCK` and a one-line note: "Caller did not provide [missing input]. Re-dispatch after [step] completes."

### Phase 2: Triage Each Decision

3. **Shortlist.** FIRST, mechanically: derive the approach's own tag set (`lambda` = creates/touches
   a Lambda; `terraform`/`iam` = touches a terraform/ or IAM surface; `secrets` = reads/stores a
   credential or authenticates externally; `deploy` = ships code/infra by any channel; `egress` =
   reads Neon/warehouse; `decisions-corpus`/`prose-docs` = edits governance docs) and shortlist
   EVERY live entry whose `category_tags` intersects it -- a mechanical set-intersection, never
   per-entry judgment (many decisions govern by ARTIFACT TYPE, not topic keyword). THEN classify
   every REMAINING entry PROVISIONALLY via title + `triage_excerpt`:
   - **CITE** -- governs the approach; the plan MUST reference it.
   - **CONTRADICT** -- the approach violates an active decision.
   - **RELATED** -- in the neighbourhood, not mandatory.
   - **IRRELEVANT** -- discard. Tag-matched + non-IRRELEVANT + any SPIRIT candidate (step 8) =
     the final SHORTLIST.

4. **Targeted read.** For every shortlisted entry, locate its heading (`rg -n "^## Decision N:" docs/DECISIONS.md`) and Read with offset/limit spanning just that heading through the next -- one section, never the source file wholesale. Confirm or refine the provisional classification against the full text; a shortlisted entry's SPIRIT quote (step 8) may be any verbatim sentence from that section, not only the excerpt.

5. For each CONTRADICT, attach a severity:
   - **BLOCK** -- the approach cannot proceed without violating the decision. Plan must pivot.
   - **WARN** -- partial conflict; a small refactor or explicit deferral note can resolve.
   - **NOTE** -- edges close to the decision's domain but does not violate it; surface for judgement.

6. **Managed-service-native check (Decision 100 / Decision 75):** flag CONTRADICT WARN when a plan
   vendors client tooling or custom scripts to replicate a capability the managed service already
   exposes natively (pg_dump/pg_restore instead of Neon branching; manual S3 copy instead of S3
   replication; custom schema-copy instead of RDS snapshot). Fires even if previously recorded as a
   "human decision" -- that does not exempt it. Decision 100 extends Decision 75 to ALL managed services.

7. **Currency filter.** Branch on the typed `currency`, never status prose. `superseded_compacted` is the ONLY value that demotes to RELATED, noted "superseded by Decision M, awareness only". `superseded_pointer` is NEVER filtered and NEVER severity-reduced: triage exactly as `current`, annotated "read against Decision M". `amended` is treated as `current` for now. No `currency` key = archived, out of scope.

8. **Spirit-alignment overlay (SPIRIT bucket).** SEPARATELY from the literal CONTRADICT triage (steps
   3-5), flag an approach that violates the *spirit* of an active decision without contradicting any
   single clause. Gated hard against noise -- defensive-over-citation applies with FULL force here.
   Emit a SPIRIT flag ONLY when ALL FOUR hold:
   - (i) **No literal CONTRADICT on the same decision.** A decision appears in at most one of the two lanes; a clause that only describes the ruling's OWN scope (e.g. "no retro-enforcement") is not a standing forward prohibition -- route it to SPIRIT.
   - (ii) **Verbatim-quotable violation.** Quote, VERBATIM, the text the approach works against: `**Intent:**`, a specific Problem/Rationale sentence, OR -- widened for bounded retrieval -- the `**Decision:**` clause (a REQUIRED marker per `docs/contracts/decision-entry.yaml`, the most reliable fallback). Ungrounded means no flag. A few terse historical live entries carry no quotable marker at all; unshortlisted, their `triage_excerpt` is empty and no SPIRIT flag can fire from the index alone -- an accepted residual, not a bug.
   - (iii) **WARN or NOTE severity only.** Never BLOCK -- that stays reserved for literal contradiction (step 5).
   - (iv) **Capped at 3.** Keep the 3 highest-severity (WARN over NOTE) if more qualify; the whole report still fits the ~1,200-word budget (step 10).

### Phase 3: Structured Output

9. Return exactly this output. Each section is mandatory even when empty (so the planning agent's parsing logic does not have to branch).

```
## Decision Scout Report

### Decisions to Cite (CITE)
- **Decision N**: [title] — [one-line reason: which clause governs which part of the approach]

(or "None" if empty)

### Contradiction Flags (CONTRADICT)
- **Decision N** [BLOCK | WARN | NOTE]: [title]
  - Contradiction: [specific clause vs specific element of the proposed approach]
  - Suggested resolution: [pivot to X | add explicit deferral note citing Decision N | clarify with human before proceeding]

(or "None" if empty)

### Related Decisions (RELATED)
- **Decision N**: [title] — [one-line: in the neighbourhood, mention if discussed]

(or "None" if empty)

### Spirit-Alignment Flags (SPIRIT)
- **Decision N** [WARN | NOTE]: [title]
  - Violated intent (verbatim): "[exact quote of the entry's **Intent:**/**Problem:**/**Decision:** marker, or a specific Rationale sentence]"
  - Divergence: [the specific element of the proposed approach that works against the quoted intent]
  - Suggested resolution: [align to X | add explicit deferral note citing Decision N | clarify with human]

(or "None" if empty)

### Verdict
NO_FLAGS | FLAGS_FOUND | BLOCK

(NO_FLAGS = no CONTRADICT entries AND no SPIRIT flags; CITE-only is still NO_FLAGS.
FLAGS_FOUND = at least one CONTRADICT at WARN or NOTE severity, OR at least one SPIRIT flag (SPIRIT is
always WARN/NOTE, so a SPIRIT flag alone yields FLAGS_FOUND, never BLOCK).
BLOCK = at least one CONTRADICT at BLOCK severity; planning agent must pivot before confirming.)

Decisions triaged: N of M
```

10. Cap total response at ~1,200 words. The planning agent reads this verbatim and surfaces it to the human; bloat dilutes the signal.

## Quality Gate (self-check before output)

Verify before returning:
- [ ] You applied the mechanical tag shortlist (step 3) before judgment, and read ONLY shortlisted entries as targeted sections -- never a whole-file load
- [ ] Every CITE and CONTRADICT entry names a decision number that exists in the index
- [ ] Every CONTRADICT entry has both a clause-level citation AND a severity
- [ ] The Verdict line is one of the three exact strings (no variations)
- [ ] "Decisions triaged: N of M" is present and N equals M (the live:true count from Phase 1 step 1)
- [ ] Total length under 1,200 words
- [ ] Every SPIRIT flag carries a verbatim quote per gate (ii) (Intent, Problem/Rationale, or Decision-clause -- no paraphrase)
- [ ] SPIRIT flags number <= 3, and no decision appears in both SPIRIT and CONTRADICT

If any checkbox is false, fix before returning. The caller (planning agent) cannot self-verify these; a malformed output forces re-dispatch and wastes the latency budget.

## Anti-patterns

- **Keyword-only CITE.** "The approach mentions 'Lambda', cite every Lambda decision." -> noise. Shortlist broadly (step 3), but CITE only when the decision's *clause* governs the approach's *action*.
- **Defensive over-citation.** Bloats the downstream summary and trains the human to skim past flags. Be ruthless: CITE only when omission would meaningfully harm the plan.
- **Hedged contradictions.** "This *might* contradict Decision N." -> either it does or it doesn't. If undetermined, mark NOTE and explain what's uncertain. Hedge in the explanation, not the classification.
- **Editing files.** Read-only. Never modify `docs/DECISIONS.md` or any other file, even to "fix a typo". File a recommendation if something is genuinely wrong.
- **SPIRIT over-citation.** The highest-noise lane -- an unquotable "this feels misaligned" is not a flag. Three well-grounded flags beat ten hedged ones.
