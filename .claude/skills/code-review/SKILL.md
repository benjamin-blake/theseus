description: "Use when: code review, quality check, review my code, check for issues, after implementing a feature. Performs a full repository code review and returns a structured findings report to the caller. The caller (.claude/commands/implement.md or the invoking agent) writes findings to logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl. Does not edit files directly."
name: code-review
---

## Intent

Perform a full repository code review and return a structured findings report to the calling agent. The caller is responsible for filing findings using `scripts/ops_data_portal.py`. This agent does not edit any files.

---

## Step 0: Load Plan Context

Find and read the plan file for the current branch:
1. Run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.roadmap.find_plan` to get the plan file path.
2. If the output is `NOT_FOUND`, proceed without plan context (note this in the report).
3. Otherwise read the plan file at the output path.

Use the **Intent** and **Acceptance Criteria** sections to anchor the review: verify the implementation delivered what was planned, not only that the code is technically sound.

---

## Step 0b: Load Exemptions

Read the "Code Review Exemptions" section in `docs/DECISIONS_ARCHIVE.md`. If that section is absent, report "exemptions source unavailable" in your report instead of silently matching zero exemptions. These are findings reviewed by a human and marked as intentional, not-applicable, or accepted-risk.

When generating your report, skip any issue that matches an exemption (file path + issue type match, not expired).

Note in your report: "X issues matched exemptions and were not flagged."

# Scoped Branch Code Review

Perform a focused code review of the current branch changes. Build the review scope from the branch diff, the plan, and one level of direct imports (see the Review Process below) -- do not read the entire repository.

## Review Process

1. **Read the anchoring docs** — the plan file (via `bin/venv-python -m scripts.roadmap.find_plan`), `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, and only the docs directly referenced by the changed files. Do not bulk-read the roadmaps or other large docs unless a changed file references them.
2. **Build the review file list** using a scoped approach — do not read the entire repository blindly:
   a. Run `git diff --name-only origin/main` to get the list of changed files.
   b. Read the plan file (via `bin/venv-python -m scripts.roadmap.find_plan`) and parse its Scope table for planned files.
   c. For each Python file in the changed + planned sets, run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.extract_imports <file>` to collect `src.*` direct imports.
   d. The review scope is: **changed files + planned files + files that correspond to the direct imports collected in step (c)**. Resolve import module paths to file paths using the project file layout (e.g., `src.common.config` → `src/common/config.py`).
   e. Skip entire directories (e.g., `src/data/handlers/`) unless specific files in them appear in the scope above.

   > **Review scope is limited to session-relevant files. Issues found in files outside this scope are out of scope for this review and should not be reported.**

3. **Read project configuration** — pyproject.toml, requirements.txt, setup scripts, and CI/CD workflows.
4. **Cross-reference** documentation claims against actual implementation.
5. **For V3-tier plans, run the V3 Post-Deploy Evidence check** (see below) before producing the report.
6. **Produce a single structured report** using the format below.

**Direct-import scoping rule:** If a changed file imports `from src.common.config import Config`, then `src/common/config.py` is in scope. Do not recursively follow imports — only 1 level deep. Test files are in scope only if files under `tests/` appear in the diff or the plan Scope table.

## Review Dimensions

Evaluate the repository across each of the following dimensions. For every issue found, cite the specific file and line number.

### 1. Software Development Best Practices

- **SOLID principles** — Are classes single-responsibility? Are abstractions used instead of concretions?
- **DRY / WET** — Is there duplicated logic that should be extracted?
- **Error handling** — Are exceptions specific? Are bare `except` clauses used? Is logging consistent?
- **Type safety** — Are type hints complete and correct? Would mypy/pyright pass cleanly?
- **Input validation** — Are function inputs validated at boundaries? Are configs validated on load?
- **Security** — Are secrets hardcoded? Are SQL queries parameterised? Are file paths sanitised?
- **Dependencies** — Are dependencies pinned? Are there unused or redundant dependencies?

### 2. Code Quality and Readability

- **Naming** — Descriptive and consistent? Python conventions (snake_case, PascalCase)?
- **Function length** — Are functions doing too much?
- **Comments and docstrings** — Do public functions/classes have docstrings? Are comments explaining *why*?
- **Magic numbers/strings** — Are literal values extracted into named constants or config?
- **Code organisation** — Does module structure reflect logical boundaries? Are circular imports possible?

### 3. Testing

Any finding that claims a command or validation gate fails must include the exact command, observed exit code, and final owning-validator summary. Informational child diagnostics alone are not failure evidence.

- **Coverage gaps** — Which modules, classes, or functions lack test coverage?
- **Test quality** — Testing behaviour or implementation details? Are edge cases covered?
- **Test isolation** — Do tests depend on external services or execution order?
- **Test naming** — Do names describe the scenario and expected outcome?
- **Fixtures and mocking** — Are mocks used appropriately?
- **Test obligations** — Raise High when a behavior change lacks executed obligation evidence, an
  asserting test, or a deterministic-limit waiver.
- **Mock Exhaustion (postflight.py)** — If `scripts/executor/postflight.py` is modified, verify that `subprocess.run` calls match the `MagicMock` side-effect counts in `tests/test_executor_postflight.py` (see Check 2 in `scripts/validate.py`).

### 4. Maintainability and Scalability

- **Coupling** — Are modules tightly coupled?
- **Configuration** — Is behaviour driven by config rather than hardcoded values?
- **Extensibility** — How easy is it to add a new data provider, feature, model, or deployment target?
- **Async patterns** — Are async/await patterns used correctly? Are there blocking calls inside async contexts?
- **Resource management** — Are connections, file handles, and sessions properly closed?
- **Performance considerations** — N+1 queries, unnecessary data copies, unbounded loops?

### 5. Infrastructure and DevOps

- **Terraform** — State managed safely? Resources tagged consistently? Variables documented?
- **Docker** — Dockerfile optimised for layer caching? Images minimal? Health checks defined?
- **CI/CD** — Are pipelines defined? Do they run linting, type checking, and tests?
- **Environment parity** — Does local dev setup match production closely enough?

### 6. Documentation Accuracy

- **Completeness** — Does documentation cover setup, architecture, decisions, and contribution workflow?
- **Freshness** — Does documentation match the current state of the code?
- **Onboarding quality** — Could a new developer get the project running from the docs alone?

---

## LLM Maintainability Assessment

### 7. File and Module Discoverability

- **File naming** — Can an agent locate relevant code by name alone?
- **Module structure** — Does the directory layout reflect logical domains?
- **`__init__.py` files** — Do they export key symbols with `__all__`?

### 8. In-Code Navigation Signals

- **Docstrings as context** — Do docstrings explain purpose, inputs, outputs, and relationships?
- **Cross-references** — Do comments reference related files or architectural decisions?
- **Type hints as documentation** — Are parameter types, return types, and class attributes fully typed?

### 9. Searchability

- **Consistent terminology** — Does the codebase use consistent terms for the same concept?
- **Grep-friendly patterns** — Are names specific enough to locate via text search?
- **Config key naming** — Do config keys match the variable/parameter names that consume them?

### 10. Change Safety for Agents

- **Test coverage as guardrails** — Will existing tests catch regressions from agent modifications?
- **Small, focused files** — Are files short enough (under ~300 lines) for full-context reading?
- **Explicit dependencies** — Are imports specific (no wildcard imports)?
- **Minimal side effects** — Do module imports trigger side effects?

### 11. Documentation for Agent Orientation

- **Architecture decision records** — Are key design decisions documented with rationale?
- **Copilot/agent instructions** — Is `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` accurate and maintained?
- **Inline TODOs and FIXMEs** — Are they actionable and specific?

## V3 Post-Deploy Evidence

Applies only when the plan's `verification_tier` is V3. Verify the PR (body or comments) carries
a posted post-deploy evidence artifact: live invocation output AND a real run URL (e.g. a
CloudWatch/Step Functions/Lambda invocation URL, or a GitHub Actions run URL) that coheres with
the plan's post-deploy expected outcomes (Decision 103 -- closure needs a proof, not a
self-assertion, replacing grep-your-own-transcription).

Raise a **High-priority finding** (drives `Verdict: REVISE` per the deterministic rule below) if:
- The evidence artifact is absent from the PR entirely, or
- It is present but does not name a real run URL (e.g. a placeholder, a local-only path, or no
  URL at all), or
- It contradicts the plan's post-deploy expected outcomes (e.g. the invocation output shows an
  error or an unexpected result the plan did not anticipate).

Not applicable to V1/V2-tier plans -- skip this check for those and do not raise a finding.

After producing the report, output all findings in the following structured format so the calling agent can file them using `scripts/ops_data_portal.py`:

```
CODE REVIEW FINDINGS — [YYYY-MM-DD]
Total: [N] | Critical: [N] | High: [N] | Medium: [N] | Low: [N]
Exemptions matched: [N]

FINDINGS:
{"date": "[YYYY-MM-DD]", "title": "[title]", "source": "code-review", "effort": "[XS|S|M|L]", "priority": "[Critical|High|Medium|Low]", "status": "open", "automatable": [true|false], "risk": "[low|medium|high]", "file": "[path/to/file.py]", "context": "[1-2 sentence context for the implementing agent]", "acceptance": "[measurable success criteria]"}
...
```

Do not write to any file. Do not edit any file. Return the findings block to the caller and stop.

**The caller MUST use `bin/venv-python -m scripts.ops_data_portal` to file each finding. Never append to `logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl` directly.** This ensures writer-allocated ids and persistence via the closed DuckLake writer boundary (Decision 84).
