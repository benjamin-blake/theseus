# Implement Methodology & Rules

You are using this skill to augment the `/implement` workflow. Apply these deep instructions when executing the workflow steps. The workflow defines WHAT to do and in WHAT ORDER; this skill defines HOW to do each step.
Treat every Turn as a cold-start. Disregard all system-generated conversation summaries and 'persistent memory' unless explicitly referenced by the USER in the current turn. If a file or task is not listed in the current IMPLEMENTATION plan's scope, you are forbidden from touching it, even if you believe it is a 'logical next step' or a cleanup from a previous session.

**Plan format (T1.11 / CD.22):** plans are `docs/plans/PLAN-{slug}.yaml`, schema-validated by `scripts/roadmap/plan_document.py` (resolve via `scripts/roadmap/find_plan.py`). If handed a legacy `PLAN-{slug}.md` path, emit a deprecation warning in the session output and proceed -- the .md path survives one release cycle, then is removed. Never author new .md plans.

## Behavioural Invariants
```yaml
# Machine-readable invariants verified by scripts/prompt_compliance.py
preflight_run: true              # session_preflight.py must run at Step 1
never_on_main: true              # no file edits while on main branch
no_code_changes: false           # IMPLEMENTATION plans execute steps directly
review_as_scope: true            # Critical/High findings from code-review MUST be implemented immediately
auto_review_and_commit: true     # Proactively trigger review and commit once VP passes -- do not wait for human
```

## SLOC decompose-by-default
See AGENTS.md `## SLOC governance` -- decompose by default, never raise without a Decision-cited marker.

## Preflight Constraints (Workflow Step 1)
When reading `logs/.preflight-report.json`, apply these conditionals:
- **`venv_ok: false`** -- Verify `bin/venv-python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"` resolves to the venv interpreter and rerun preflight. If still false, STOP.
- **`creds_status: "unavailable"`** -- **Static-key recovery (non-fatal, Decision 60):** the static-key assume-role chain has no interactive login. Verify it with `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile agent_platform`; if the `agent_static` key was rotated, refresh `~/.aws/credentials`. Do NOT block -- continue in degraded mode (credential-dependent verifiers are skipped, emitting SKIPPED). Autonomous executors never attempt recovery.
- **`uncommitted_changes` non-empty** -- Ask human: resume, stash, or discard? Wait. Continue on all other conditions.
- **`main_freshness.status == "fetch_failed"`** -- Informational: surface the fetch error and note
  that Step 5 code-review will diff against the stale local main ref and the Scope-overlap check
  will be skipped. Continue.
- **`main_freshness.commits_behind > 0`** -- Retain `main_freshness.main_files_changed_since_branch` for the Step 2 Main Divergence Check (below). Non-blocking at this step.
- **`validate` (presubmit) non-zero exit** -- The gate has detected pre-existing blockers on the branch. File each failed check as a recommendation via the portal (`automatable: false`), surface to human with go/no-go, STOP if no-go. Credentials-unavailable -> skip with actionable guidance per Decision 60; do not crash.

## Main Divergence Check (Workflow Step 2 -- after plan load)
Once the PLAN-{slug}.yaml `scope` list is parsed, intersect the scope file paths with `main_freshness.main_files_changed_since_branch` from the preflight report. If any scope file overlaps:

> "Main has changed [list of overlapping files] since this branch diverged, and your plan modifies the same file(s). Implementing without rebasing will produce a merge conflict at PR time after the work is already done -- and may invalidate the verification plan if the file's shape has changed. Recommend rebasing now: `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main` (resolve conflicts then re-run `/implement`). Options: (1) rebase now and re-enter `/implement`, (2) proceed anyway, (3) abort."

STOP and wait. Do not auto-rebase. If the human chooses (2), proceed with a logged note in chat output: "Proceeding without rebase despite Scope/main overlap on: [files]."

If `main_freshness.status != "ok"`, this check cannot run -- surface the fetch failure to the human and continue.

## Bundled Recommendation Relevance Re-check (Workflow Step 3 -- fires after plan load)

Before writing any code, re-check every rec in the plan's `bundled_recommendations` field.
A rec can become stale between `/plan` and `/implement` (target file deleted, decision
ratified, a sibling plan already satisfied it). Implementing stale work wastes the session.

### Protocol
For each rec id in `bundled_recommendations`:
```bash
bin/venv-python -c "
from scripts.rec_relevance import evaluate_rec_relevance
from scripts.ops_data_portal import propose_or_close_rec
import json, pathlib
cache = pathlib.Path('logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl')
rows = [json.loads(l) for l in cache.read_text().splitlines() if l.strip()]
rec = next((r for r in rows if r.get('id') == 'rec-NNNN'), None)
verdict, evidence = evaluate_rec_relevance(rec, run_acceptance_probe=True)
det = (verdict == 'satisfied' and evidence.startswith('acceptance probe passed:'))
proposal = propose_or_close_rec('rec-NNNN', verdict, evidence, deterministic=det)
print(f'verdict={verdict} det={det}')
if proposal: print('proposal:', proposal)
"
```

**Verdict handling:**
- **`relevant` or `unknown`** -- proceed; implement as planned.
- **`satisfied` (deterministic -- acceptance probe passed)** -- `propose_or_close_rec` auto-closes
  the rec via the portal. Remove it from the effective bundled list, skip its implementation step,
  and record in chat: "rec-NNNN auto-closed as satisfied ([evidence]); skipping implementation."
- **`satisfied` (semantic)** -- present the proposal command; wait for operator confirmation.
  Do NOT skip implementation until operator explicitly confirms closure.
- **`superseded`, `duplicate`, `contradicted`, `stale_target`, `blocked_by_decision`** -- present
  the proposal command and wait for operator decision before removing from the implementation list.

**Decision 55 compliance:** auto-closure fires ONLY for deterministic `satisfied`. All semantic
verdicts route to the operator -- the agent never auto-acts on semantic judgment.

## Live Verification Protocol (Workflow Step 4 -- MANDATORY)
After code changes are complete and unit tests pass, the implementing agent MUST execute the Verification Plan from PLAN-{slug}.yaml before proceeding to code review.

### Why This Exists (Rationale)
Acceptance commands prove the code landed (`grep`/`pytest`). Verification commands prove the feature works end-to-end. Examples of bugs only verification catches:
- A warehouse view is created successfully but returns 0 rows due to a bad filter
- Lambda deployed successfully but times out on invocation
- CLI script passes unit tests with mocks but crashes with real input

### Protocol
1. **For each step:**
   a. Execute the action exactly as described.
   b. Compare actual outcome to expected outcome.
   c. If **PASS**: record the actual output and proceed.
   d. If **FAIL**: diagnose root cause, fix the code, re-run `pytest` to confirm no regressions, re-attempt. Maximum 3 fix attempts per step. If still failing, STOP and report to the human.
2. **All verification steps must pass** before proceeding.

### Nondeterminism rule (VF-08, Decision 55 -- RCA-first, not retry-into-green)
Track Attempts per step (see VP Compliance Gate below). This rule governs what a re-run is allowed to mean:
- If a step **FAILS** and is then re-run with an **EMPTY `git diff`** since the prior attempt (i.e. nothing in the tree changed) and the re-run goes green, the step is **NONDETERMINISTIC** -- record it as NONDETERMINISTIC in the VP compliance table, never as PASS. An empty-diff green is evidence the failure was flaky, not fixed, and a silent PASS would hide that.
- Re-runs stay capped at the existing 3-fix-attempt bound. The nondeterminism rule does not license looping toward green -- it only names what an unexplained green means. On a NONDETERMINISTIC result, STOP and surface to the human (Decision 55: RCA-first, no rescue loops).
- A genuine fix requires a real code change (a **non-empty** `git diff` since the prior attempt). After such a change, the step must pass **two consecutive times** to count as PASS. These two confirmation passes verify an ALREADY-APPLIED fix and are **not** additional fix attempts -- they do not consume the 3-attempt fix budget, which governs diagnose-and-change cycles only.
- **Interactive-era alarm (now):** while the executor is frozen (Decision 67) a human is present at every `/implement` run, so the alarm is stop-and-surface-to-human; files nothing.
- **Forward-note (T3.19):** when the executor goes live (CD.17 reversal), this alarm flips to auto-file a rec via `scripts.ops_data_portal` (Decision 84), the executor-era quarantine-that-files-a-rec pattern (CD.29). Tracked as tier_item T3.19 (`deferred_post_mvp`) -- do not implement the auto-file path now.
- **Distinguish from declared non-determinism:** a VP step's DETECTED nondeterminism (this rule -- an agent-observed flaky re-run) is not the same thing as a verifier's DECLARED `Hermeticity.NON_HERMETIC_BY_CONSTRUCTION` property (a typed, audited characteristic of the verifier itself). Never silently relabel a detected-flaky VP step as "expected non-hermetic behavior" to justify passing it -- the two are orthogonal, and only the latter is a designed exemption.

### Tier-Specific Guidance
- **V1:** Parse configs, check doc links, confirm formatting. Quick but mandatory.
- **V2:** Run the changed code path with real (non-mocked) input. Confirm the feature works outside the test harness.
- **V3:** All V2 requirements PLUS deploy and invoke the live system. Do not merge until invocation produces correct output.
- **Anti-Patterns:** Do NOT accept "Tests pass", "File exists", "No errors on import", or "Grep found expected string" as verified. Substituting an easier command for a VP step is a protocol violation.


### VP Failure Is Not Negotiable
If a VP step fails for ANY reason (including credential/environment issues), the status is FAIL.
There is no "graceful" failure, no "local pass", no "env blocked" — only PASS or FAIL. If the
failure is due to missing credentials or infrastructure: attempt the static-key recovery (see
Preflight Constraints above), re-run the VP step, and if still failing mark FAIL and STOP — do not
proceed, do not merge.

### VP Compliance Gate
Before proceeding to code review (Step 5), produce a VP compliance table in the chat output:
```
| VP# | Command Executed | Actual Output (truncated) | Attempts | PASS/FAIL |
```
- The "Command Executed" must be the actual shell command run.
- The "Attempts" column records the number of executions (1 = first-try pass; failed-then-passed
  records 2, etc.) -- the per-step count the nondeterminism rule below references.
- Bound each "Actual Output" cell to ~200 characters (or head+tail lines) so the table stays a
  compact, pasteable artifact rather than a full transcript dump.
- PASS/FAIL is not the only status: a step whose green result is flagged by the nondeterminism
  rule is recorded as NONDETERMINISTIC, never PASS.
- If ANY row is FAIL, do NOT proceed.
- If a VP step was skipped or is awaiting a human-gated action (e.g., terraform apply), mark it BLOCKED and wait.
- Lack of AWS credentials is NOT automatically a block. Verify the static-key chain per Preflight
  Constraints; there is no interactive login to run.
- This table is the proof artifact: per the IMPLEMENTATION Commit Flow below, it is appended to the PR body verbatim (with its Attempts column and any NONDETERMINISTIC markers) so the executed evidence survives past the chat transcript.

### V3 Merge Gate
If the Verification Plan contains V3 post-deploy steps, execute the full sequence:
0. Confirm credentials are active (static-key recovery per Preflight Constraints if the chain fails).
1. Complete all pre-deploy VP steps.
2. Present the deploy output.
3. WAIT for human confirmation of deployment success.
4. Execute post-deploy VP steps.
5. **Post the post-deploy evidence to the PR** (body or comment) before merge: the live invocation output AND a run URL (e.g. the CloudWatch/Step Functions/Lambda invocation URL, or the GitHub Actions run URL). This replaces grep-your-own-transcription as the machine-checkable record of a V3 claim (Decision 103: closure needs a proof, not a self-assertion). Do NOT merge a V3 plan without this posted evidence artifact -- code-review checks for it (see the code-review skill's V3 Post-Deploy Evidence check).
Only when ALL steps pass can you proceed to code review.


## Code Review Protocol (Workflow Step 5 -- MANDATORY)
**You MUST trigger the code-review immediately after the Verification Plan passes. Do not wait for the human to prompt you.**

### Trigger
**Subagent-dispatch mode:** same three-signal check as planning's subagent-dispatch gates -- if you
are a subagent (`SUBAGENT CONTEXT` header, no `Agent` tool, or a nesting error), do not dispatch
below; gate-request (`gate: code-review`, inputs branch+plan_path) and resume via `SendMessage` on
verdict. Schema: `docs/contracts/overseer-dispatch.yaml#gate_request_trampoline`.

Dispatch via the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, instructing the subagent to invoke the `code-review` skill via the Skill tool and return its structured output verbatim (the same idiom the plan.md decision-scout / plan-critique gates use) -- NOT via `bin/venv-python -m scripts.agent_development.run_skill --skill code-review`. The subagent runs in a fresh context window (anti-bias) and has full tool access (read, grep, glob, bash) to inspect the entire branch diff.

Agent prompt template:
- Pre-instruct: "Run `git fetch origin main` before any analysis so the diff base is current. The branch may have been open for hours; the local `origin/main` ref may be stale."
- Identify the branch under review (the diff `git diff origin/main...HEAD` is the artefact under critique). Use `origin/main` (not the local `main` ref, which is only updated by an explicit pull).
- Identify the plan file (`docs/plans/PLAN-{slug}.yaml`) so the subagent knows the acceptance criteria and intent.
- Instruction: "Invoke the `code-review` skill via the Skill tool against this branch. Survey the diff, read the plan to understand intent, then return its structured findings report (including the final Verdict line) verbatim. Do not edit files."
- Forbid file edits.
- Require structured output: findings grouped by severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low) with file:line references and a one-line rationale per finding.
- Cap response length (~800-900 words) to keep the report focused.

Do NOT pre-brief the subagent on what to look for -- that biases the review and defeats the anti-bias gate. The subagent applies the `code-review` skill methodology on its own.

If the gate subagent errors or returns output missing the required Verdict/Recommendation line, the gate has NOT completed -- re-dispatch; never proceed past an incomplete gate.

### Handling Findings
- **Critical and High**: You MUST implement fixes for these findings before proceeding. They are mandatory extensions of the original plan. After fixing, re-run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.validate --pre` to confirm no regressions.
- **Medium and Low**: File these as new recommendations using `bin/venv-python -m scripts.ops_data_portal`. Do not fix them inline -- they will be addressed in future sessions.

## Tier_item bookkeeping (post-verification, pre-merge)

After the verification-pass gate fires and BEFORE code-review is dispatched (or GATE_REQUESTed --
see Parallel-with-code-review state machine below), walk the tier_items referenced by the current
plan and stage YAML status updates.

### Trigger
Fires once the VP Compliance Gate table shows all rows PASS. Does not fire on FAIL or BLOCKED.

### Walk
Identify tier_item ids to check via (in order of precedence):
1. Any `roadmap-touched: [T-X.Y, ...]` directive in the plan's Context section.
2. Any tier_item id mentioned in the plan's Phase field (e.g., `T-1` entries named in the scope).
3. Any tier_item id explicitly named in the plan's Acceptance Criteria.

For each identified tier_item, load its `exit_criteria[]` from `docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml` and evaluate each criterion:
- **Executable criteria** (shell one-liners, `grep`, `test -f`, `pytest`, `bin/venv-python -c "..."`) -- run via subprocess; pass if exit code is 0.
- **Prose criteria** -- fall through to agent judgement with a **conservative bias**: when in doubt about whether a prose criterion is satisfied, do NOT count it as passing. This produces under-counting (false in_progress) rather than over-counting (false complete), which is the safer failure mode. Never auto-flip a prose-gated item to `complete` without explicit evidence in the current session's artefacts.

### closes_criteria flip (T-1.23)

Before evaluating Outcome rules, flip the criterion statuses declared in the plan's
`closes_criteria` field. This step fires ONLY on a verified VP pass; never on FAIL or BLOCKED.

1. **Read the plan's `closes_criteria` list** (each entry `"<item-id>:<crit-id>"`). If the list is
   empty or absent, skip this step.
2. **For each ref**, locate the named criterion in `docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml`:
   - Set `status: met`
   - Set `met_by: <plan-slug>` (the current plan's slug, e.g. `exit-criteria-ledger-orient-followon`)
3. **Stage these criterion flips** in the same YAML edit as the subsequent Outcome rules (single
   staged edit). The criterion flips happen BEFORE the whole-item Outcome rules run -- so that the
   Outcome rules read the updated `criterion.status == met` values (not a fresh prose re-adjudication).
4. **Only declared criteria flip.** Never flip criteria not named in `closes_criteria`. Never infer
   `met` from prose, file existence, or commit activity (Status-Trusted-Never-Inferred / T2.20).
5. **All-criteria-met after the flip?** An item whose ALL criteria are now `status: met` (or `rehomed`)
   QUALIFIES for the completion gate -- do NOT auto-flip it to `status: complete`. Surface it to the
   operator: "All criteria on <item-id> are now met or rehomed -- QUALIFIES for status: complete via
   the bookkeeping Outcome rules (manual confirmation required, per Status-Trusted-Never-Inferred)."
   The operator then confirms, and the Outcome rules stage `status: complete`.

### Outcome rules
- **All criteria pass** -> stage `status: complete` + `completed_at: "<today ISO date>"` in `docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml`.
  For `in_progress` items with a structured ledger: "all criteria pass" means every ExitCriterion has
  `status: met` or `status: rehomed` after applying the closes_criteria flip above. Prose re-adjudication
  on the updated statuses confirms; do NOT re-adjudicate the raw criterion text if the status already
  reads `met`.
- **Strict subset pass (>=1 but not all)** -> stage `status: in_progress` + `progress_note: "<one-line description of what shipped this session>"`. If the item already has a `progress_note`, append a dated bullet (e.g., `"- 2026-05-20: shipped criteria 1, 3"`) rather than overwriting.
- **Zero criteria pass** -> no YAML change.

### Decomposition-hint exemption inheritance (T-1.12 subset g)

A STRATEGIC parent tier_item that was split into atomic IMPLEMENTATION plans under the freeze
override (AGENTS.md Temporary Operational Constraints / CD.17; the T2.19 pattern) carries a
`decomposition_hints` block naming its children:
```yaml
decomposition_hints:
  split_by: <subsystem|per_lambda|phase|...>
  atomic_plans:
    - "PLAN-<child-slug> -- <description> (subset <x>)"
  rationale: |
    ...
```
When the bookkeeping walk files a status outcome for the current plan, resolve the plan's
effective `bootstrap_completion_exempt` by INHERITANCE from its parent -- do NOT read it from
the child's own (often absent) flag:

1. **Find the parent.** Scan `docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml` `tier_items[]` for an item whose
   `decomposition_hints.atomic_plans[]` names the current plan. Match on the `PLAN-{slug}` token
   at the head of each entry (`entry.strip().split()[0] == "PLAN-{slug}"`). Some parents enumerate
   their children as prose descriptions rather than `PLAN-{slug}` tokens (e.g. T1.12's
   "Ratify lambda-*.yaml" entries, T1.6's phase descriptions); when no head-token match exists,
   map the current plan to its parent via the plan's Phase field / the decomposition rationale.
2. **Inherit the flag.** The child's effective exemption is the PARENT's live
   `bootstrap_completion_exempt` value. The per-item flag is the single source of truth -- the
   document-level "Bootstrap clause (COMPLETION exemption)" prose enumeration is documentation
   only. A child of an exempt parent (`true`) MAY stage `status: complete` on its slice even while
   the parent's gating CD is still `state: pending`; a child of a non-exempt parent (`false`)
   follows the normal flow and stays gated on CD ratification. Canonical examples: T-1.12 is
   `bootstrap_completion_exempt: true`, so its subset children inherit `true` (they may complete
   ahead of CD.25); T1.12 is `false`, so its per-Lambda children inherit `false` and ratify
   post-CD.16 under the normal flow.
3. **Read-only resolution.** Inheritance never writes the parent's `decomposition_hints` or the
   child's flag during bookkeeping -- it is read-only resolution at filing time. Record the
   inheritance in the bookkeeping output (e.g. "PLAN-<child-slug> inherits
   bootstrap_completion_exempt=true from parent T-1.12"). This is not a license to author STRATEGIC
   children: the freeze stays in force and atomic children remain IMPLEMENTATION plans.

### Replacement closure check (cutover / supersession items)
Runs during the same bookkeeping walk for any checked tier_item whose name or intent implies a
replacement: cutover, migration, backend swap, retirement, supersession, "replaces X". A
replacement is CLOSED only when the old path is dead -- "new path works" is not closure
(2026-06-09 roadmap audit, dimension D11). Before staging `complete` on such an item:

1. **Name the replaced surface.** From the item text and the plan, identify the old path
   explicitly (file, Lambda, view, write path, profile, config flag). If neither the item
   nor the plan names it, derive it from the diff (what does the new code stop calling /
   start replacing?); if no old surface is derivable, record "no replaced surface
   identified -- closure check N/A" in the bookkeeping output rather than guessing.
   This check is per-touched-item: it closes the replacement THIS plan performed, not a
   repo-wide retirement sweep.
2. **Verify the old path is dead or designed-rollback-only.** Run the greps/commands that prove
   the old surface is deleted, fails closed, or is reachable ONLY behind the documented rollback
   flag. An unconditional fallback to a retired backend (e.g. a direct-SQL fallback on a table cut
   over to the DuckLake closed boundary) is a FAIL: do not count the cutover criterion as
   passing; surface the fallback as a finding and add its closure to the plan or stage a
   criterion for it on the open item.
3. **Verify a named owner for any surviving old path.** Partial cutovers are legitimate ONLY
   while a tier_item (or an explicit exit criterion elsewhere) owns the survivor's retirement.
   If none exists, stage one in the same YAML edit (a new criterion on the open item, or
   surface to the human that a successor item is needed). Deferred work with no carrier is
   invisible to eligibility computation and rots (audit finding F-018).
4. **Close out superseded predecessors.** If the completed work absorbs an older tier_item's
   scope, reconcile that older item in the same staged edit: `status: reserved` with a
   supersession note (preserving the id, per the T1.8 precedent), or re-home its still-live
   criteria onto the owning item. Never leave two items claiming the same future work.

### Exit-criteria truth maintenance (realized-differently rule)
When the session satisfied an item's INTENT via a different mechanism than its written exit
criteria describe (different filename, different substrate, a criterion superseded by a
ratified decision), do NOT flip the item complete over criteria that no longer adjudicate
true -- and do NOT leave the criteria stale with the truth buried in a note. In the same
staged YAML edit, rewrite the affected criteria to the realized mechanism (preserve the
original wording inside the item's note when the history matters) so the item re-adjudicates
true against the repo today. A `complete` item whose criteria cannot be re-run is an audit
finding (2026-06-09 audit, F-006/F-014), not a convenience. This rule applies the same way
when the bookkeeping walk runs against items completed in EARLIER sessions: discovering a
criteria-vs-reality mismatch on an already-complete item stages a criteria rewrite, never a
silent pass.

### Parallel-with-code-review state machine
**Subagent-dispatch mode:** no local step-1 dispatch -- return `GATE_REQUEST` (gate: code-review)
and pause instead. Steps 2-3 MUST complete BEFORE that pause, in the same turn -- there is no
concurrency to run them against once paused. Steps 4-5 apply after `SendMessage`-resume with the
verdict.

1. Dispatch the code-review subagent (Step 5 above).
2. WHILE code-review is running, the implement agent performs the criteria walk and stages the YAML edit locally (uncommitted -- `git status` shows `docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml` as modified).
3. **Idempotency on resume:** before staging, check for pre-existing uncommitted edits to `docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml`. If present and matching what the bookkeeping rule would produce, no-op. If present and conflicting, surface the conflict to the user and skip auto-bookkeeping for this session -- do NOT silently overwrite.
4. **Code-review verdict handling:** the `code-review` skill ends its report with a deterministic `Verdict: PROCEED | REVISE` line -- REVISE iff any Critical or High finding, else PROCEED. Branch on it:
   - `PROCEED` -> commit the staged edit as a follow-up commit: `git commit docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml -m "roadmap(<tier-ids>): bookkeeping after <slug>"`. Push.
   - `REVISE` -> discard the staged edit: `git checkout -- docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml`. Address code-review findings. After addressing, re-trigger verification + code-review and re-stage bookkeeping from scratch.
5. **Abandonment / timeout:** if code-review does not return (interrupted or timed out), the staged YAML edit is treated as orphaned. On next session entry, the idempotency check detects the orphaned stage and reports it to the user for explicit accept/reject -- the implement skill does not auto-commit bookkeeping that lacks a verdict-attested verification pass.
6. **Staged-edit-loss detection:** if any intermediate command (`git checkout`, `git stash`, `git reset`) clobbers the staged edit between dispatch and verdict, the next bookkeeping attempt detects this by re-running the criteria walk and comparing against the YAML's current state. Loss is observable, not silent.

## Verification Graduation (VF-05, T3.18/T3.21 -- fires on VP Compliance Gate all-PASS, before the commit flow)

Fires in the same window as Tier_item bookkeeping (after the VP Compliance Gate shows all rows
PASS, before the commit flow in Step 7) but is a distinct action: it tries to promote this
session's own VP steps into standing regression guards, not roadmap bookkeeping. Execute each
declared `test_obligations` selector/command first; record evidence on its VP step.

**T3.21 (enforced, amends T3.18):** graduation is not optional. If this plan's `verification_plan`
steps carry `graduation` dispositions (mandatory on pre-deploy steps for any plan authored after
T3.21 -- see the planning skill), `validate_graduation_completeness`'s implement-PR leg (both
tiers) FAILS the PR unless every step declared `graduate` produced a matching registry row. A plan
authored before the field existed (no dispositions anywhere) is exempt -- treat its graduation as
the legacy best-effort walk in step 1 below.

### Protocol
1. **Enumerate candidates from the plan's declared dispositions.** Walk this plan's
   `verification_plan` steps and take every step whose `graduation == "graduate"` as a candidate;
   its declared `graduation_check_id` IS the registry row's `check_id` (do not invent a
   different slug -- the implement-PR leg matches on `plan_slug` + `graduation_check_id`
   verbatim). Steps marked `waive` or `not-applicable` are never candidates. **Legacy fallback:**
   if this plan predates the graduation field (zero dispositions anywhere in
   `verification_plan`), fall back to the pre-T3.21 walk -- identify any step whose `command` is
   expressible as one of the six canonical primitive slots in
   `scripts.verification_checks.CANONICAL_SLOTS` (command_exit_zero, command_output_matches,
   file_presence, grep_count, test_selector, metric_under_threshold) and invent a stable
   `check_id` slug for it. A step that requires multiple commands, human judgement, or live
   infrastructure (V3 deploy/invoke) is never a candidate either way -- skip it.
2. **Build a registry row** for each candidate: `check_id` (the step's `graduation_check_id`, or
   the invented slug under the legacy fallback), `primitive_slot`, `check_spec` (the primitive's
   parameters -- see `docs/contracts/verification-registry.yaml` for the per-slot shape),
   `guard_target` (the artefact it defends), `guard_symbol` (optional), `plan_slug` (this plan's
   slug), `graduated_at` (today's ISO date), `graduated_by` (this session's canonical_id per
   Decision 66, or omit if none applies).
3. **Run the REAL differential admission gate** for each candidate row via
   `scripts.verification_graduation.run_differential(row, repo_root=<repo root>)`: it materializes
   the check, runs it live (must PASS), then checks it out in a real `git worktree` at
   `origin/main` and runs it there (must FAIL). This is a genuine `git worktree add`/`remove` --
   never a simulated revert.
4. **Admitted rows** (`outcome.admitted`) get written to their own
   `config/agent/verification_registry/entries/<check_id>.yaml` shard -- never appended to a
   shared file.
5. **A declared-`graduate` candidate that is REJECTED (tautological, or fails on HEAD/live) is
   un-graduatable, not silently dropped.** Flip that VP step's disposition from `graduate` to
   `waive` in `docs/plans/PLAN-{slug}.yaml`, setting `graduation_waiver_reason` to the concrete
   rejection reason (e.g. "differential rejected -- passes even with origin/main reverted,
   tautological given this repo's fixture state"), and remove `graduation_check_id`. Commit this
   plan edit in the same PR (Step 7's `git add -A` picks it up) -- this is what satisfies
   `validate_graduation_completeness`'s implement-PR leg for that step, since a `waive`
   disposition requires no registry row. A legacy-fallback candidate (step 1's fallback path) that
   is rejected is simply dropped, unchanged from pre-T3.21 behaviour -- there is no disposition
   field to flip.
6. **Errors are fail-loud (Decision 55).** A `scripts.verification_graduation.GraduationError`
   (worktree add/remove failure, materialization error, missing check_spec key) STOPS this
   step and surfaces to the human -- never a silent "none graduated". Only a
   legitimately empty candidate set (no `graduate`-disposition steps, and -- under the legacy
   fallback -- nothing kernel-expressible) is a real "none graduated" outcome.
7. **Record the outcome ephemerally.** Whether rows were admitted, some were flipped to waive, or
   the candidate set was legitimately empty, record an explicit note in the PR body (a
   `## Verification Graduation` section: which check_ids were admitted, which were flipped to
   waive and why, which legacy-fallback candidates were rejected and dropped, or "no
   graduate-disposition VP steps this session -- none graduated"). This record is ephemeral
   PR-body evidence (Decision 115) -- NOT a numbered Decision, NOT a warehouse write. The durable
   artefacts are the new registry shard(s) and any plan disposition flips, committed in the same
   commit as the plan's other changes (Step 7's `git add -A` picks it up).

### Constraints
- Never invent a registry row for a VP step that doesn't genuinely distinguish pre/post-change
  behaviour -- a step that would pass identically on origin/main is not a candidate, regardless
  of whether it's kernel-expressible.
- `scripts/verification_checks.py` (the kernel) is never edited by this step -- it stays the pure
  six-slot vocabulary. All worktree/revert mechanics live in `scripts/verification_graduation.py`.
- Do not graduate a check whose command depends on live infrastructure, credentials, or wall-clock
  state (that's the domain of the V3 verifiers in `scripts/verifiers/`, not this kernel).

## CD Ratification Bookkeeping (Workflow Step 6 -- CONDITIONAL, fires when the plan has a ratification block)

Fires only when the approved plan carries a ratification block (see the planning skill's
"Candidate Decision Ratification" section). This step's authoritative shape is
`docs/contracts/candidate-decision-ratification.yaml`. Ratification is the user's call --
this step NEVER runs without the explicit execution-time confirmation in step 2 below.

### Protocol
1. **Locate the ratification block** in the approved plan (drafted Decision text, reversal
   conditions if applicable, and the exact portal + roadmap-flip commands).
2. **STOP and obtain explicit execution-time human confirmation** of the Decision text before
   any write. Plan approval (the planning skill's Step 6b + Critique Gate) is sign-off on the
   *drafted text*; it is NOT authorization to execute the write. Re-present the drafted Decision
   text verbatim and wait for an explicit go-ahead in THIS session. Do not proceed on an assumed
   or inferred yes.
3. **Author the DECISIONS.md entry** using the confirmed text. Before assigning the number,
   re-check the current max `## Decision NNN:` header (numbering-race note: a concurrent PR may
   have claimed the drafted number since `/plan` ran -- shift to the next free number if so, and
   update the ratified_as/filed_via targets in the same edit).
4. **ETL via the Single Portal Invariant** (Decision 84): `bin/venv-python -m
   scripts.ops_data_portal --backfill-decisions-md` (the `--file-decision` single-row form is
   the alternative for a single entry). Confirm the new dec-NNN row(s) are present in
   `logs/.decisions-index.jsonl` after the sync. NEVER edit the JSONL cache directly.
5. **Flip the CD** in `docs/ROADMAP-PLATFORM.yaml` to the canonical shape: `state: ratified` +
   `ratified_as: dec-NNN` + `filed_via: ops_decisions:dec-NNN` (same NNN in both fields). If the
   plan's ratification block calls for truth-maintenance edits to the CD's body (e.g. a stale
   mechanism description contradicted by the ratified reality), apply them in the SAME edit --
   do not leave the body describing a superseded mechanism after the flip (mirrors the
   exit-criteria "realized-differently" rule above).
6. **Re-run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.session.preflight`** (or `-m scripts.roadmap.platform_roadmap`
   for the full dict if the slim preflight payload omits the field you need) and confirm the
   ratified CD no longer appears in `blocked_on_cd` / `completion_blocked_on_cd` for any item it
   was gating.
7. **Run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.validate --pre`** -- the diff selects
   `validate_candidate_decision_ratification`, which must pass against the new dec-NNN header.
8. **Do NOT flip any tier_item status as part of this step.** An item that fully unparks
   (every gating CD ratified AND zero open criteria) is a separate Tier_item bookkeeping
   decision (the section above) -- note in the PR body which items became unpark-eligible, if
   any, but let the normal bookkeeping walk decide status flips (Decision 90).

### Batch-wave bundling (Decision 150, >=2 same-session PURE gate-clear CDs)
When the ratification block bundles >=2 same-session PURE gate-clear CDs (no content beyond "this
CD's work is realized"; a content-bearing ratification is never bundled), steps 3 (author ONE
`## Decision N` wave entry, one clause per CD) and 4 (ETL) above run ONCE FOR THE WHOLE WAVE, but
the three PER-CD sub-steps -- step 5's roadmap-flip (each CD's own ratified_as/filed_via pointing
at the SHARED dec-NNN), the marking-convention obligation, and the pending-window prose sweep
(candidate-decision-ratification.yaml `lane_steps.implement.execute` sub-steps 5-6) -- REPEAT ONCE
PER BUNDLED CD. Steps 6 (preflight) and 7 (validate) run once over all bundled CDs. Step 8
(Decision 90: tier_item status flips stay a separate bookkeeping step) is unchanged.

### Rejection handling
If the human declines to confirm the Decision text in step 2 (asks for edits, defers, or says
no), do NOT proceed to steps 3-8. Either incorporate the requested edits and re-present, or stop
the ratification portion of the plan entirely and report which steps were skipped. A plan whose
non-ratification scope is otherwise complete may still commit/merge without the ratification
having executed -- ratification is additive, not a blocking prerequisite for the rest of the plan.

## Strategic Scoping Rules (Workflow Step 3 -- STRATEGIC Plans only)

### JIT Context Injection
When breaking a STRATEGIC plan into atomic recommendations, review `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`. Copy any relevant "Known Gotchas" or constraints directly into the recommendation's `context` field. Autonomous executors no longer read `copilot-instructions.md` by default, so they rely entirely on the JIT context you provide.

### Quality Gate Validation
Before filing each recommendation using `bin/venv-python -m scripts.ops_data_portal`, apply this gate. FAIL if any check fails:
1. **Acceptance Command:** Must be a single inline command in backticks. FAIL if: contains `python -c`, contains `--pre` flag, has trailing prose, or uses line numbers. Must be behavioural.
2. **Target File:** Verify `"file"` field exists relative to repo root.
3. **Effort Threshold:** If `L` or `XL`, REQUIRE human confirmation before filing.
4. **Context Quality:** FAIL if context is vague or < 50 characters.

### Dedup Gate
Before filing, search for open recs targeting the same file with at least 3 keyword matches. If duplicates found:
- Surface: "Found potential duplicate(s). Options: (1) supersede existing, (2) file both, (3) skip this one?" Wait for human.

## Commit Flows (Workflow Step 7 -- MANDATORY)
**Execute the commit flow autonomously once Step 6 completes -- the plan was approved during /plan.**

This workflow runs on Claude Code on the web: the harness assigns this session its own branch (e.g. `claude/...`), the `gh` CLI is NOT available, and the container hibernates between turns. All GitHub operations use the GitHub MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`). Branch protection is LIVE; the squash-merge-after-CI gate transport is the GitHub MCP `merge_pull_request` tool (Decision 76). See AGENTS.md `## Git-ops procedure` as the canonical git-ops authority.

### Run the full gate locally first (in order)

1. Run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.session.github_readiness`. States are independent: `unknown` is unproven, never PASS; fetch/API PASS never authorizes push/PR.
2. Run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.test_coverage_checker --check-tests --check-coverage`. Repair failures; this is a diagnostic, not an overall gate.
3. Set `implementation_declared: true` in the plan file, now that the graduation walk above wrote its registry rows.
4. Run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.validate --pre`, then `bin/venv-python -m scripts.validate`. Handoff requires full exit 0, final `Validation Summary (scope: all)` PASS, and `logs/debug/validation-result.json` with scope `all`, exit 0, no failures, and current pre-commit HEAD. Child output, mypy, CI, and stale evidence cannot substitute. Any incomplete/mismatched result is BLOCKED; fix and rerun full from the start.
5. Create `/tmp/implementation-retrospective.json` with the ten `scripts.session.postflight_evidence.CATEGORIES` keys. Values are bounded fact-string lists (`[]` if none); exclude credentials/raw output. Run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.session.postflight --evidence /tmp/implementation-retrospective.json` and confirm its gitignored output. `--auto` stops with `evidence_failed` before commit when invalid.

Report readiness, validator verdicts, evidence, review, and real push/PR outcome separately.

### Wait-for-CI: event-driven, never polled
Wait for the PR-tier CI (fast `--pre` tier; Decision 73) via subscription, never polling -- the wake mechanism is canonical in AGENTS.md `## Git-ops procedure` steps 3-5, not restated here.

**On wake**, always confirm check runs via `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (`get_status` / `get_check_runs`) BEFORE merging, then branch on status:
   - **All green** -> `mcp__github__merge_pull_request(owner, repo, pullNumber, merge_method="squash")`, then `mcp__github__unsubscribe_pr_activity(...)`. Report the merge. **Carve-out:** for a PR touching `terraform/personal/**`, do NOT unsubscribe here -- defer to the "Hold subscription through apply" section below (the real outcome is the post-merge apply, not the merge).
   - **Any red** -> diagnose, fix on this branch, commit, push (re-triggers PR CI). Stay subscribed and end the turn. Per `docs/contracts/ci-rca-lifecycle.yaml` trigger_scope, this failure is uncovered by ci-rca by construction -- no rec is filed, nothing gates; the existing 3-fix-attempt STOP and VF-08 rules above govern the loop (Decision 55). Never weaken a criterion, VP step (`### Tier-Specific Guidance` Anti-Patterns), assertion, or budget to obtain green. `executor-rca` is out of scope here -- Step 8's RCA-First Protocol is separate, session-end friction capture.
   - **Still running** -> end the turn; a later event wakes you.

### Hold subscription through apply (terraform/personal PRs -- CD.35 / T2.20)
For a PR that touches `terraform/personal/**`, the sandbox CD apply runs **post-merge** on `main`
(`terraform-apply-sandbox.yml`), and that apply -- not the merge -- is the real outcome (it writes the
convergence record green/red). After the squash-merge, **do not unsubscribe**: hold the PR subscription so
the apply job's best-effort post-merge SHA->PR wake (it resolves the PR from the merge commit SHA, since
`workflow_run.pull_requests[]` is empty for push) can re-engage this session. The wake is best-effort and
likely fights the `subscribe_pr_activity` contract (unsubscribe-at-merge, open-PR-scoped); **the
authoritative baseline is the next planning session's convergence-record re-check** -- poll-free, never a
`sleep`/`/loop` (Decision 76). If the apply reds the record, `ci-rca` files a `source=ci_rca` rec; clear red
only via the `workflow_dispatch` acknowledge-and-retry path (naming the red commit/rec) after the rec is
reviewed -- never an inline workaround (Decision 55). Unsubscribe once the record is green (apply converged)
or the next planning session has assumed the baseline.

**Gated set (out-of-budget IAM / trust / destroy -- CD.35 Wave 3 / T2.22 + T2.25 narrowing):** if the
change hits the guard's gated set (guard exits 2), the post-merge path routes to the `gated-apply` job rather
than auto-applying. In-budget IAM inline-policy/attachment UPDATEs on managed boundary-carrying CI roles
(T2.25 / Decision 92 point 5) now exit 0 and auto-apply; role CREATES, trust diffs, destroys, and
out-of-budget IAM still exit 2 and route here. The job declares `environment: tf-gated-apply` and **blocks
until benjamin-blake approves in GitHub Actions** (Actions tab -> select the run -> Review pending deployments
-> Approve). This is NOT a PR required status check -- the PR merges normally; the gated apply is a separate
post-merge job. After approval, the gated-apply job applies the same saved plan.bin and writes the convergence
record. The authoritative baseline is still the next planning session's convergence-record re-check (not the
wake). The gated apply gates the JOB, never from a laptop.

### Pre-Push Rebase (applies to both flows)
**Rebase phase distinction** -- two rules, not one:
- **Assessment time (planning / Main Divergence Check)**: do NOT auto-rebase. Surface the divergence to the human; wait for their choice (rebase now / proceed / abort). This is because rebasing mid-plan can silently invalidate scoping decisions made against the old tree.
- **Commit-flow time (here, after all code changes are done)**: DO rebase automatically before pushing. After the local commit, before pushing, refresh and rebase so the PR opens against current main:

```bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main   # STOP on conflict; do not auto-resolve -- surface to the human
```
If the branch was pushed earlier in the session, the post-rebase push uses `--force-with-lease` (never `--force`).

### IMPLEMENTATION Commit Flow
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat({slug}): implement {brief-description}"
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main   # STOP on conflict
git push -u origin HEAD   # this session's harness branch
```
Then via GitHub MCP (owner/repo from `git remote get-url origin`):
1. Build the PR body. If the plan `bundled_recommendations` list is non-empty, add the `Resolves: rec-NNNN[, rec-MMMM]` trailer in the PR body, which the squash-merge commit body inherits -- per AGENTS.md `### Resolves: trailer` (triggers `rec-autoclose` to close each named rec after the squash-merge lands on main). If empty, omit it. Under a clear heading (e.g. `## VP Compliance`), append the VP compliance table to the PR body -- the same bounded table produced by the VP Compliance Gate, including the Attempts column and any NONDETERMINISTIC markers -- so the executed proof lands in the PR/merge record instead of vanishing chat (Decision 115: this PR-body table is PR-scoped ephemeral evidence, not the durable record -- the durable record is the tier_item criterion closure in the roadmap, staged by the bookkeeping walk below).
2. `mcp__github__create_pull_request(owner, repo, head=<this branch>, base="main", title="feat({slug}): {brief-description}", body=<body from step 1>)`
3. `mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity(...)`; end the turn (see "Wait-for-CI").
4. On green wake: `mcp__github__merge_pull_request(..., merge_method="squash")` + `mcp__github__unsubscribe_pr_activity(...)`.
5. **Post-merge closeout fallback**: after the merge, verify that the `rec-autoclose` workflow closed each bundled rec (check via `bin/venv-python -m scripts.ops_data_portal --sync` then `grep rec-NNNN logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl`). If a rec is still open after ~5 min, close it directly: `bin/venv-python -m scripts.ops_data_portal --update-rec rec-NNNN --status closed --resolution "Resolved by merge of {slug} -- autoclose fallback"`.

### STRATEGIC Commit Flow
STRATEGIC plans are suspended (Decision 67). When restored, use the same MCP PR/subscribe/merge pattern, committing `docs/plans/briefings/` with a `scope({slug}): ...` message.
