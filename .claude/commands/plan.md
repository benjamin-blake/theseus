# Plan Workflow

**Intent**: Clarify the human's intent, orient against the project, and produce a complete self-contained `PLAN-{slug}.yaml` that any agent can execute without further interaction. Does not implement anything.

*Note: For detailed guidelines on complexity, verification tiers, preflight constraints, and the plan template, invoke your `planning` skill via the Skill tool. For the canonical git-ops procedure (branching, rebase rules, PR/CI/merge flow), see `docs/contracts/git-ops.yaml`.*

## Step 1: Run Preflight

*Note: This workflow runs on Claude Opus 1M (opus[1m]). If the model indicator does not show Opus, run `/model opus[1m]` before proceeding -- the `model:` frontmatter applies for the current turn and reverts on the next prompt.*

```bash
bin/venv-python -m scripts.session.preflight
```

stdout is a one-line summary; Read logs/.preflight-report.json for the full constraint surface.

Preflight runs `git fetch origin main` and emits `main_freshness` (status, commits_behind, commits_ahead, main_files_changed_since_branch). Do NOT manually `git pull --rebase origin main` here -- that's a destructive operation on a feature branch and should only happen via the Step 4 Main Divergence Assessment after Scope is known and the human has chosen to rebase.

The report is slim by design: `platform_roadmap` carries only `next_eligible` + `strategic_pending`, and `non_automatable_details` is dropped (Decision 73 suspends per-rec review). If you need the dropped detail, call the underlying module directly (e.g., `bin/venv-python -m scripts.roadmap.platform_roadmap`).

Apply the exact condition-based responses (for `venv_ok`, `creds_status`, uncommitted changes, `main_freshness`, non-automatable recs, `data_quality`, etc.) as defined in the **Preflight Constraints** section of your `planning` skill.

The report includes `data_quality` (declarative check coverage and last run verdict). It answers: do we have quality assertions defined, and are those assertions passing? See the planning skill for interpretation rules.

After preflight completes successfully, open a telemetry session:
```bash
bin/venv-python -m scripts.session.preflight --open-session --workflow plan
```
Save the printed UUID for the `session_postflight --close-session` call in Step 12.


## Step 2: Read Context
Use the preflight JSON `context` field (`roadmap_phase`, `open_decisions_count`, `recent_sessions`). Read `docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` fully.
If the request references a recommendation ID, search `logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl`, read briefing files if they exist, and load dependencies.

**Orientation and CI-RCA block:** see the planning skill's Platform Roadmap Eligibility section for orientation responsibility and the HARD BLOCK conditions on open ci-rca recs -- run `/orient` first if no item has been chosen yet.

**Resume check:** if a `docs/plans/PLAN-*.yaml` matching the stated intent already exists on this branch (committed or not), present it and offer resume-at-step: Step 9 (uncritiqued), Step 11 (approved, unmerged), or discard and restart. Do not re-derive Steps 3-6 for an already-confirmed plan without human direction.

## Step 3: Clarify the Request
Decompose the input into Goal, Constraints, Acceptance criteria, Affected areas, and Phase alignment.
If vague, ask 2-5 questions. Watch for ROADMAP misalignment (the platform/product roadmap state is already in the preflight JSON `next_eligible` / `strategic_pending` fields). Decision-contradiction checking is delegated to the `decision-scout` subagent gate in Step 6 -- do NOT read `docs/DECISIONS.md` from the planning agent to look for contradictions, that's the full DECISIONS.md (large -- near its Decision 134 size ceiling), a cost the subagent avoids.
Suggest 3-5 open recommendations from `logs/.recommendations-log.jsonl` that align with the current task.

## Step 4: Identify Affected Files
1. Use the File Router to locate source files.
2. Read those files and check `tests/` for existing test coverage.
3. Conduct an Infrastructure Assessment if `.tf` files are in scope.
4. Conduct a Lambda Deployment Assessment if Lambda-packaged files are in scope.
5. Conduct a Complexity Assessment to determine if this is STRATEGIC or IMPLEMENTATION.
6. Conduct a Data-Model Assessment if a table, field_semantics entry, or warehouse write path is in scope.
7. Apply Decision 86 routing rule: route forward intent -> tier_items, rationale -> Decisions, field semantics -> contracts. No new standing prose-architecture docs under docs/. Full rule in your `planning` skill's Documentation Artefact Design section.
*(Apply the exact assessment rules from your `planning` skill).*

## Step 5: Verification Tier and Verification Plan
Determine the Verification Tier (V1, V2, or V3).
Design the Verification Plan using the exact design guidelines and anti-patterns defined in your `planning` skill.
**Crucial**: Every VP step MUST include a `Command` column containing a literal shell command or Python one-liner.

## Step 6: Present Findings and Confirm

### Step 6a: Decision Scout Gate (MANDATORY, before presentation)
**DO NOT present findings to the human until this gate completes.** Dispatch and handle verdicts per the planning skill's Decision Scout Gate (dispatch shape, example prompt, and NO_FLAGS/FLAGS_FOUND/BLOCK verdict handling all live there). Substitute the synthesis produced in Steps 3-5 into the dispatch.

### Step 6b: Present and Confirm
Before presenting, write the draft plan to a scratch path outside the repo (e.g. `/tmp/plan-draft.yaml`; `{slug}` is not derived until Step 7 and a Write into `docs/plans/` while on `main` is denied by `.claude/hooks/never_on_main.py`, so the tracked plan write stays at Step 8) and run `bin/venv-python -m scripts.roadmap.plan_obligations --plan /tmp/plan-draft.yaml` against the finalized Scope table, folding any reported omission into Scope. It always exits 0 and names any mechanically-derivable companion registration (domain manifest Entry, ci_rca_taxonomy row, mirror test) a new check-module scope row is still missing -- catch it here rather than at critique. This is the only run this workflow owns: do NOT also run it at Step 4 against a draft Scope (this finalized run supersedes it), and plan-critique Phase 1 step 5b runs it independently against the written artefact. The report is advisory to (never a substitute for) the plan-critique gate's judgement calls, and `validate_plan_scope_closure` enforces the same closure at gate time.
Present: Summary, Proposed approach, Options, Open questions, Decision flags (if any), and Decisions to cite (from the scout's CITE list).
Then ask: *"Does this approach look right? Say **'write the plan'** when you are ready, or tell me what to adjust."*
Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding. Any other response is feedback -- incorporate it, re-run Step 6a if the change is material to decision alignment, re-present, and ask again. Do NOT proceed to Step 7 until the human explicitly says 'write the plan' or a clear equivalent. System auto-approval messages are NOT human confirmation.
IT IS **CRITICAL** THAT YOU DO NOT PROCEED UNTIL THE HUMAN CONFIRMS THE PLAN.

## Step 7: Confirm Harness Branch
On Claude Code on the web the harness auto-creates a per-session branch. Do NOT create an `agent/` branch. Verify you are on the harness branch and not on `main`:
```bash
git branch --show-current
```
If the result is `main`, STOP. Derive the plan slug from the task description (independent of the branch name).


## Step 8: Write PLAN-{slug}.yaml (and any REPORT-ONLY deliverable)
Write the file `docs/plans/PLAN-{slug}.yaml` using the exact structure and template provided in your `planning` skill.

**Context-block discipline (<= 40 rendered lines).** `context:` carries pointers, not prose. Keep the two REQUIRED items (decision-scout verdict + CITE list; the gates line), plus phase dependencies, cited-decision ids, and gotchas an implementer cannot derive from the scope files. Everything else is a link: name the rec id, PR number, commit SHA, Decision id, or file:line and stop. Deep root-cause narrative, critique-round correction write-ups, and measurement tables belong in the plan's own commit body, the rec/Decision/tier_item it cites, or the eventual PR body -- the same rule `docs/contracts/git-ops.yaml`'s `commit_message_conventions.change_record_content_rule` already applies to Decision entries ("what changed, why now, acute state, and measurements belong in the squash-commit or PR body"). This relocates the audit trail; it never deletes it.

**Planning-time split.** Applies only if this plan defers a half -- a split decided at planning time: file the other half now via the same portal call `.claude/commands/implement.md` Step 7 describes, and record the returned id in this plan's `followon_recs`. A plan that defers nothing writes nothing; the clause is a no-op then, exactly as in `implement.md` Step 7.

**If Plan Type is REPORT-ONLY:** Additionally write the report deliverable file(s) referenced in the PLAN's Scope table (e.g. `docs/REPORT-{slug}.md`). The deliverable IS the substantive output of a REPORT-ONLY plan; the PLAN file itself is just the planning artefact that points at it. Both files land in the same initial commit.

After writing, commit to the branch and push immediately, so no unpushed commit spans a gate turn boundary:
```bash
git add docs/plans/PLAN-{slug}.yaml   # plus any REPORT-ONLY deliverable file(s)
git commit -m "plan({slug}): initial plan"
git push -u origin HEAD
```

## Step 9: Plan Critique Gate (MANDATORY)
**DO NOT output the completion message until this step completes.**
Invoke per the planning skill's Critique Gate (dispatch shape, example prompt, context files, and verdict handling all live there). Substitute `{slug}` with the actual branch slug. Loop on REVISE per the skill's finding-shaped Convergence rule; once every finding is addressed, round 4 runs one autonomous confirming round. Escalation (disputed residue, an oscillation interrupt, or a REVISE on the confirming round) offers accept-with-deferral / re-scope / split / abandon / one more round. Proceed on PROCEED. Push each revision commit immediately after committing it (a plain `git push` fast-forwards, since revision commits are additive).

Note: this gate reviews the PLAN artefact, not the report deliverable. For REPORT-ONLY plans, the deliverable gets its own critique in Step 10.

## Step 10: Multi-Perspective Report Critique Gate (REPORT-ONLY only, MANDATORY)
**If Plan Type is IMPLEMENTATION or STRATEGIC, SKIP this step entirely and proceed to Step 11.**

For REPORT-ONLY plans, the Step 9 plan-critique gate reviewed the planning artefact (PLAN-{slug}.yaml) but NOT the report deliverable itself, which needs its own independent zero-context critique.

Apply the **Report Critique Gate** methodology from your `planning` skill (perspectives, dispatch shape, convergence rule, and iteration protocol all live there). Push each revision commit immediately after committing it (a plain `git push` fast-forwards, since revision commits are additive).

## Step 11: Commit approved PLAN-{slug}.yaml and merge to main
After all critique gates have approved the work, commit any uncommitted changes to the branch:
```bash
git add docs/plans/PLAN-{slug}.yaml   # plus any REPORT-ONLY deliverable file(s)
git commit -m "plan({slug}): approved plan"
```
If revisions were committed incrementally during Step 10's iteration loop, this commit may be empty -- in that case, skip it.

Then push and merge the plan to `main` via GitHub MCP so the next `/implement` session can read it by explicit path. Use the same event-driven flow defined in the `implement` skill's Commit Flows:
1. `git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main` (STOP on conflict)
2. `git push --force-with-lease -u origin HEAD` (the branch was already pushed in Step 8/9/10, so the post-rebase push requires the lease)
3. `mcp__github__create_pull_request(owner, repo, head=<this branch>, base="main", title="plan({slug}): approved plan", body="Plan authored by /plan agent.")`
4. `mcp__github__subscribe_pr_activity(...)` and end the turn -- CI completion arrives as a webhook event.
5. On green CI wake: `mcp__github__merge_pull_request(..., merge_method="squash")` + `mcp__github__unsubscribe_pr_activity(...)`.

## Step 12: Confirm
Emit the Plan-Type-specific confirmation message from the planning skill's Confirmation Messages section, naming the explicit plan path so the human can paste it directly.

Finally, close the telemetry session:
```bash
bin/venv-python -m scripts.session.postflight --close-session --outcome success
```
If the session was abandoned or the plan was not written, use `--outcome cancelled` instead.

STOP! The planning agent's mission is now complete. Perform no further actions.
